The increase in harmful cyanobacteria blooms threatens freshwater ecosystems and presents a risk to human health.  A survey of 29 inland lakes was conducted to investigate possible drivers of microcystin. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify the microcystin variants. In parallel, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) was also used to measure total microcystin. Quanitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) was used to detect and quantify the 16s ribosomal RNA (\emph{16s rRNA}), \emph{mcyE}, \emph{cyrA} and \emph{sxtA} gene targets responsible for microcystin and nodularin, cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin. Measurement of nutrient concentrations and water quality parameters were conducted. With Geographic Information System (GIS), geographical properties for each lake was calculated. I hypothesized total microcystin would be positivly associated with lake's with urbanized watershed. In our survey, total microcystin did not correlate with urbanization. We found turbidity and lake watershed area to be associated with total microcystin.
