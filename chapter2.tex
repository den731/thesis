\chapter{Harmful Algal Blooms and Correlation to Geochemical Features}
\section{Introduction}

In the pursuit to understand what drives \gls{hab}, an extensive survey was conducted on 29 inland lakes. Every month between July to October of 2017, a sample is taken at every lake.
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Water Sampling} \label{sampling}

Water samples were collected by wading in toward the center of the lake until water height reached waist height. All water grab samples were taken roughly one foot below water surface. Each water collecting vessel was rinsed 3 times with the lake water before obtaining final sample. A total of 4 team of field surveyors sampled each with designated lakes. At each lake, a hand-held multi-meter was used to measure pH, conductivity ($\mu$S/cm), dissolved oxygen (mg/L) and temperature ($^\circ$C). Phycocyanin and chlorophyll fluorescence were also measured using an portable fluorometer by Amiscience with the optical excitation of 470 nm and 590 nm and the emission is read at 685 nm, which is measured in \gls{rfu}. Each fluorometer for each surveyor was calibrated against rhodamine WT\footnote{Sodium chloride 4-[3,6-bis(diethylamino)-9-xantheniumyl]isophthalate (2:1:1)} dye as a secondary calibration standard, which ensured the calibration is relative to other fluorometer and to prevent drift. A portable meter from Hach was used to measure turbidity in \gls{ntu}. Formazin standards were used to calibrate the turbidity meter.

In July 2017, a constructed sampler float was installed at each lake. The sampler was constructed by the Dr. Raffel's team, which consisted of 3 plexi-glass plates and placed at each sampling location for the purpose of collecting zebra mussels (see figure \ref{fig:samplerr}). The stack of three square plexiglass sheets were about 15cm,20cm, and 25cm in diameter which gives them a total surface area of 0.23 m$^2$ per sampler. In addition, also installed a slotted PVC pipe which contains a \gls{spatts}, a beta test of a new method of monitoring toxins. This method will be disscussed in chapter \ref{ch:spattss}. A majority of samplers were installed on the riparian owner's dock, or as a float. HOBO Pendant\texttrademark temperature and light logger were installed on floats at each lake site. In October, we collected the samplers and scraped all mussels into a glass mason jar for analysis of biomass.

Water sampling kits were prepared by storing pre-labeled water vessels in zip-lock bags for each lake to prevent cross-contamination between different lake water samples during sampling transport and storage. Each sampling kit contained 60mL \gls{petg} vials for MC analysis, 100mL sterile IDEXX bottles for QPCR analysis, 50mL polypropylene centrifuge vials and 250 mL \gls{hpde} Nalgene bottles for nutrient analysis. Each kit also provided alkaline Lugol's iodine solution for preserving cyanobacteria samples for identification and 3M \ch{H2SO4} for acid preservation of nutrient samples. The 3M \ch{H2SO4} is in a separate zip-lock bag with roughly 20g of \ch{NaCO3} wrapped in paper towel to neutralize the sulfuric acid incase of a spill or a leak. Lugol's iodine solution was prepared by dissolving 100g of \ch{KI}, 100g of \ch{I2} and 100g of sodium acetate dissolved in 1 liter of water. See figure \ref{fig:samplekit} for an example of a sampling kit.

\subsection{Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry} \label{sc:lcms}

The collected water samples were stored in 60mL \gls{petg} vials. Within 3 days from sampling, the water samples were freeze-thawed for 3 cycles for cell lysis. Water samples are thawed slowly in a heated water bath at 37$^\circ$C, then frozen at -20$^\circ$C. Once finally thawed,
a 3.500 ml aliquot of each sample above was transferred to glass vials suitable for the Thermo Scientific EQuan MAX (online sample concentrator).
These sample were transported to Wayne State University  and analyzed for 12 MC congeners and nodularin.  The Westrick group at the WSU Lumigen Instrument Center has developed a high-throughput \gls{lcmsms} analysis for microcystins in surface and drinking water analyses.
The analysis done by the Westrick group's LC-MS/MS platform includes a Thermo Scientific EQuan MAX (online sample concentrator) and ThermoFisherâ€™s UltiMate 3000 \gls{uhplc} system and a \gls{tsq} Quantiva.

Their method is similar to EPA method 544 with the addition of 5 more congener analytes \cite{shoemaker_method_2015}. Figure \ref{fig:spectra} shows a standard chromatogram of all 12 microcystins, nodularin, and the ethylated internal standard (\ch{[C_2D_5]} MC-LR) eluting between 2.2 and 5.2 minutes allowing for the total analyses time to be less than 12 minutes.  The \gls{mdl} are 0.030  $\mu$g/L  for microcystins.

\subsection{Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay}

A commercial Microcystin/Nodularins ADDA ELISA kit was used from Abraxis to analyze total microcystin\footnote{https://www.abraxiskits.com/products/algal-toxins/}. The analysis uses a polyclonal antibody which specifically binds to the ADDA moiety found in MC. However it does not distinguish between different congeners and the given results are in terms of MC-LR equivalance. The analysis followed the reccommended guidelines provided by the EPA \cite{usepa_method_2016}. In preperation of loading the plate,  100$\mu$L of standards, controls, blanks and samples are aliquoted into a seperate sterile 96-well plate. To minimize assay drift caused by slow plate loading, a multi-channel pipettor was used to load the the standards, controls, blanks and samples to the final 96-well plate. The assay procedures were carried out and read by Synergy H1 microplate reader from Biotek.

\subsection{Nutrients}

Two 125-mL \gls{hpde} Nalgene bottles were used to collect acid-preserved water samples with 2 mL of 3M \ch{H2SO4}, resulting to pH \textless 2. A 50-mL centrifuge tube is used to collect water samples without acid preservation for orthophosphate. One of the two Nalgene bottles is allocated for ammonia-N and nitrate+nitrite-N by our lab at Oakland University, and the other is for total phosphorus and total nitrogen run by Ben Southwell and his team at Lake Superior State University.  Samples were kept  at 4 $^\circ$C during transport and stored at -20$^\circ$C. Upon receiving samples from field samplers samples are thawed if frozen and cool at 4$^\circ$C. All lake water samples were homogenized by inverting 8 times and aliquoted into 15-mL centrifuge vials and centrifuged at 3000rpm for 45 seconds. The supernatant was collected into a clean 3-mL vial to be prepared for the AQ1 auto sampler. All samples were analyzed within the appropriate time frame from time of sampling collection.

Nutrient concentrations are quantified by colorimetric analysis with  AQ1 from SEAL Analytical\footnote{SEAL Analytical Inc.
6501 West Donges Bay Road Mequon, Wisconsin 53092}, a discrete colorimetric analyzer.  Ammonia-N (\ch{NH3}) is quantified by a reaction with dichloroisocyanurate and dissolve ammonia to create chloramines which  forms a blue-green color with salicylate which is measured at 660 nm \cite{usepa_method_1993-2}. The range of application is between 0.02-1.0 mg N/L with a mininum detection limit of 0.006 mg N/L for quantifying ammonia.  Nitrate+nitrite-N (\ch{NO3^{-}} $+$ \ch{NO2^{-}}) is analyzed with an open tube copperized cadmium coil which the pH buffered sample water will have nitrate reduced to nitrite. The reduced water sample is then reacts with sulfanilamide with the presence of $N$-(1-napthyl)-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a reddish color measured at 520 nm \cite{usepa_method_1993}. The range of application for analyzing nitrate+nitrite is between 0.25-15 mg N/L with a detection limit of 0.04 mg N/L.  Orthophosphate-P (\ch{PO4^{-3}}) is analyzed with acidic molybdate solution with antimony potassium tartrate to form a complex with dissolved orthophosphate. The complex is reduced with ascorbic acid to create a blue color measured at 880 nm \cite{usepa_method_1993-3}. The range for orthosphosphate is between 0.003-0.3 mg P/L with 0.008 mg P/L as the detection limit. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen-N (organic nitrogen) is analyzed by sample digestion with copper(II) catalyst at 380$^\circ$C. Nitrogen containing compounds such as amino acids and peptides are converted to ammonia which is then reacted with hypochorite to create chloramine, which is then reacted with salicylate at a pH of 12.6 with the presence of nitroferricyanide to form a green-blue color measured at 670 nm \cite{usepa_method_1993-1}. The range for total Kjeldahl nitrogen is between 0.2 to 4.0 mg N/L with 0.07 mg N/L as the detection limit. Total phosphorus (polyphosphates and some organic phosphorus)  is analyzed by acid-persulfate digestion which water sample with ammonium persulfate and sulfuric acid is autoclaved at 121$^\circ$C for 30 minutes which organic phosphorus is converted to orthophosphate. After digestion, orthophosphate is reacted with acidic molybdate which is reduced by ascorbic acid to create a blue color measured at 880 nm \cite{usepa_method_1993-3}. The range for total phosphorus is between 0.01-1.0 mg P/L with 0.02 mg P/L as the detection limit. 

\subsection{Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction}

Phytoxigene CyanoDtec\texttrademark cyanobacteria and toxin test kit was preformed with Applied Biosystem StepOnePlus\texttrademark \gls{qpcr}. The kit provides two separate assay mixes. Total cyanobacteria assay will quantify the 16srRNA gene copies found in the water sample. Both the total cyanobacteria and toxin gene assay  were analyzed in parallel for each month of grab samples. The primer/probe sequence is unknown.  The PCR reaction mix contained 5 $\mu$L of template/sample extracts and 20 $\mu$L of rehydrated mastermix.  Each sample were run in singlicate due to limited resources. Positive standards for target genes  were run on each PCR analysis. Phytoxigene\texttrademark CyanoNAS nucleic standards were used to generate standard curves for quantification of gene copies. The CyanoNAS was removed from -20$^\circ$C and allowed to thaw prior to analysis.  Standards were run in duplicates.

Samples for QPCR were filtered either on site with portable Santino pump, or brought back to the lab for filtration within 8 hours from sampling.
At each lake, 100mL or more of water sample was collected in a sterile IDEXX vessel then filtered through a 0.4$\mu$m pore size polycarbonate membrane  and stored at -20$^\circ$C until QPCR. Once filtered, they are immediately transferred into BioGX vials. BioGX vials are stored at -80$^\circ$C until analysis. BioGx vials contains 500 uL of lysis buffer, lysis beads and filtrate. For cell lysis, vials were vigorously shaken by bead beater on the highest setting for 2 minutes. After bead beaten, sample vials were centrifuged for 1 min. After centrifuge, 50 $\mu$L of the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5 min, then roughly 25 $\mu$L of the final supernatant to another set of microcentrifuge tubes for PCR template.  Sample extracts are stored at 4$^\circ$C and analyzed within 4 hours.

From following the recommended guide by Phytoxigene, the PCR heat cycles were programmed with initial denaturing step at 95$^\circ$C for 2 min, then a repeating of 95$^\circ$C for 15 seconds and 60$^\circ$C for 30 seconds reaching a total of 40 cycles. The appropriate gene target filters were manually set to match the emission spectra of each probe.  For each PCR run, a standard curve was generated  from within the StepOnePlus software. CT threshold and baseline were manually assigned for each run by visually assessing each target run. The calculated gene copies are done automatically by the StepOnePlus software, expressed in gene copies/$\mu$L of lysate. The final reportable value is calculated by this equation:

\begin{center}
  $Genecopies/mL = (Genecopies/\mu L \: of \: lysate) \times (\frac{500\mu L \: of \: lysate}{\text{mL of Sample Volume}})$
\end{center}

\subsection{Geographic Information System Analysis}

Watershed delineation and calculation of land use were done using \gls{qgis} \cite{qgis_development_team_qgis_2009}.
Elevation data was downloaded in bulk by an FTP client as mosaic raster files for the state of Michigan downloaded from USGS \footnote{\url{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/}}.
Elevation data  prepared by using $r.fill.dir$ function from \gls{grass} which fills sinks or depressions \cite{grass_development_team_geographic_2017}. A flow accumulation raster map is generated from this command. The value of each cell designates the amount of flow based on drainage characteristics the elevation data. Visually viewing the histogram of the distribution of flow accumulation values, selecting the highest values displays will display the most probable areas the flow of water will be. The pour point is where the lake's outlet, where the water is most likely to leave. This provided visual aid in selecting the pour point of each lake. A new shapefile was created and selected each lake's pour with the visual aid of stream flow lines. Using the $r.distance$ function from GRASS, it snapped each pour point to the proper place to help the delineation step. Each lake's watershed was delineated using $r.drain$ to create a elevation model map derived from the flow accumulation raster file. The drainage raster file is then used as an input for function $r.water.outlet$ along with the coordinates of fixed pour point location, which gives the shape of each lake's watershed extent.

Land use data was downloaded from the 2006 National Land Cover Database \cite{homer_development_2004}. The land use data were classified at Anderson level-II, which has 20 different classification of land distinguishing different biomes and regions.  To simplify the land use data, the raster is reclassified into 8 Anderson level-I categories using $r.recode$ tool from GRASS. The 8 reclassified Anderson level-I classes with band ID are water (11, 12), developed (21,22,23,24), barren, (31,32,33), shrubs (41,42,43), forest(52), agriculture (71), herbaceous (81,82) and wetlands (90,95). The land use raster file was transformed into a vectorized shapefile. The shapefile was merged by union (or dissolved) by each lake's watershed, which resulted area of each land use class within each lake's watershed. This data was exported as a .csv file and prepared for statistical analysis.

Precipitation data were retrieved from the \gls{ghcn} database from \gls{noaa} \cite{menne_global_2012}. Daily precipitation data was downloaded from NOAA's FTP server \footnote{\url{ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/}}.  The geolocation of each rain gauge station were imported into QGIS and mapped. The distribution of the rain gauges were not uniformally distributed. Thiessen/Voronoi polygons for each station were generated and overlayed on each watershed. The area of each thiessen/voronoi polygon's intersection with the corresponding catchment is divided by the area of the lake's watershed to give a weighted value. The mean areal precipitation for each lake's watershed is calculated by taking each station's measurements and multiplying by the weighted value, then averaged together.  Ambient air temperature for each watershed is simply averaged together with their intersection of the lake's watershed. Precipitation data with each sampled lake is joined by lakes watershed. Averaged 3, 5, 7, and 30 days lagged precipitation and ambient air temperature were calculated for our analysis.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Each analytical measurement was compiled and organized by each sampling event. We have data sampled from Lake Superior, Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie, however with my discussions with Dr. Szlag and Dr. Raffel, we decided to exclude them in our analysis.  Their unique geology and lake morphology does not fit our focus on inland lakes.
Data manipulation and analysis was done in Program R, a statistical computing language \cite{r_core_team_r:_2018}. The ``dplyr'' package was primarily used for data cleaning, compiling and preparation to have our dataset ready for statistical analysis \cite{wickham_dplyr:_2017}. We also used other packages with program R to for additional tools to rearrange our data matrix \cite{robinson_broom:_2018}, display our graphs\cite{wickham_ggplot2:_2009,schloerke_ggally:_2017, garnier_viridis:_2018, wei_r_2017} and create statistical summary tables \cite{leifeld_texreg:_2013,  wickham_tidyverse:_2017, zhu_kableextra:_2018, hlavac_stargazer:_2018, robinson_broom:_2018} for exploratory analysis.

The requirements for building our model using linear regression assumes the distribution of explanatory and response variables to follow a normal distribution \cite{bates_fitting_2015}. The compiled dataset contained in total of 115 observations from the 29 inland lakes.
From our collected dataset, we assessed each variable's distribution and $log10$-transformed to fit a normal distribution. In order to solve the problem of data values that are zero, we added the corresponding minimum detection limit first, then applied a log transformation. See table \ref{tab:variables} for a summary of which variable was transformed and the shorten variable name.

For selecting the best predictor variables, a best subset linear regression analysis was used to find good predictors that can potentially explain our response variables using the ``leaps'' package from R \cite{miller_leaps:_2017}.  Measurements from each lake is a factor that may contribute as a random effect. This can be an issue where measurements from each lake is pseudo-replicated \cite{eisenhart_assumptions_1947}. Best subset and correlation matrix analysis is done on an averaged dataset based on each lake which works around this issue.
With the best variables from the regression subset, backward step-wise regression will be preformed to further refine the best fit model. Variables will be backwardly selected by F-test using simple linear regression \cite{kenward_method_1987}. Finnaly, a linear mixed effect analysis is used to verify our best models as it allows to account the variance of each sample site without taking the average of each lake site. The predictor variables are set as fixed effects and lake site as random effects with varying intercepts. A visual inspection of the residual plots is done to check if the models deviate from homoscedasticity.  The linear mixed effect models were built on the full dataset as this accounts for the variance of each of our lake site\cite{crawley_r_2007}. The library package ``lme4'' is used for our linear mixed modeling \cite{bates_fitting_2015}. Each non-nested models are rank by the lowest \gls{bic} being our best model.

In our sampled lakes for the summer season of 2017, $log10$(MC) concentration and \emph{16s rRNA} were slighly different between each monthly sample (see figure \ref{fig:time3}). We found the MC concentrations to be the highest in the month of August with an average of 1.13 $\mu$g/L compared to 0.182, 0.357 and 0.326 $\mu$g/L for the months of July, September and October. The pattern for the concentration of \emph{16s rRNA} followed similarly, but peaking in September with an average of 6.72x$10^5$ cp/L compared to 2.37x$10^4$, 5.30x$10^5$ and 4.01x$10^5$ cp/L for July, August and October. Water temperature when measured both at the time of sampling and the HOBO loggers we observe a steady decline with each month, however, we did not observe a noticable fluctuation with light intensity (see figure \ref{fig:hobo}). With our sampling regime, we did not sample in the spring or early summer months and did not sample frequently to observe a clear temporal trend.

Of all the sampled lakes, we did not detect any cylindrospermonsin in our surveyed lakes. Moreover,  QPCR analysis did detect genes responsible for producing cylindrospermonsin (\emph{cyrA}) and saxitoxin (\emph{sxtA}). We detected varying amounts of \emph{mcyE} gene copies in each lake.  From the \gls{lcmsms} we found one instance of anatoxin-a detected at Brighton lake in August 2017 which was sampled during an visible bloom (2.80 $\mu$g/L of Anantoxin-a).

In our analysis of MC, MC-RR, MC-LR and MC-LA were the most detected congeners throughout the summer.  MC-RR was found with the highest concentrations 8.55 $\mu$g/L at Brighton Lake in August (see figure \ref{fig:congenerbar}).  Majority of our samples were below the EPA guidance level. From our sampled lake sites, Belleville, Brighton, Ford, Hudson, and Wixom Lake had instances of MC concentrations that exceeded the EPA guidance level of 4 $\mu$g/L both from \gls{lcmsms} and ELISA analysis (see figure \ref{fig:microcystin}).

\subsection{Comparison of Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Liquid Chromatography/Mass-spectometry in Tandum}

\gls{lcmsms} and ELISA are compared there are discprenancies between the two, analysis from ELISA tends to be report higher values than \gls{lcmsms}. The difference is more apparent in the month of September and October, where the difference can be quite large (see figure \ref{fig:month}). The ELISA generally presents a higher result than \gls{lcmsms}. This is in part due to the detection limit and reportable limits being much higher for the ELISA, 0.15 and 0.1 $\mu$g/L. However, our analysis in the month of August had good agreement between \gls{lcmsms} and ELISA.

\subsection{\emph{A Priori} Hypothesis Test}

In my hypothesis, I expected developed land-use percentage to have a positive influence on MC concentrations. Much of the southern lakes were vastly dominated by developed land such as Belleville, Ore, Brighton, Ford and Bogie Lake. 
Developed land-use percentage plotted had a slight positive effect with $log10$(MC) concentration , however the relationship was not significant  ($\beta=0.59$, $F_{{1,27}}=1.75$ , $p=0.20$)(see figure \ref{fig:developed}) . There were no significant relationship with developed land-use percentage in predicting $log10$(\emph{16s rRNA}) gene copies ($\beta=0.48$, $F_{{1,25}}=1.75$ , $p=0.27$). However, developed land-use had a positive significant relationship with log10(nitrate+nitrite) ($\beta=0.75$, $F_{{1,27}}=1.08$, $p=0.018$)

Forest land-use percentage had a significant negative relationship with $log10$(\emph{16s rRNA}) gene copies ($\beta=-1.42$, $F_{{1,25}}=7.08$, $p=0.013$)(see figure \ref{fig:forest}). Albiet, forest land use did not have a significant effect on $log10$(MC) concentrations ($\beta=-0.34$, $F_{{1,26}}=0.32$, $p=0.57$).

With the surveyed lakes, 17 out of 29 had Zebra mussels found in the month of October. The average MC concentrations with  of Zebra mussles present was 0.568 $\mu$g/L, and absent with 0.305 $\mu$g/L. Using a two sample Student's t-test, we fail to reject the null where difference of the mean is greater than 0 ($t=1.14$, $df=107$, $p=0.13$). We also did not find any significant relationship with the mussel counts and mass with predicting MC concentration.

\subsection{Exploratory Analysis}

With our model selection, a correlation matrix analysis was done to observe any possible collinear relationships between our predictor variables. The correlation matrix analysis showing only significant relationships and arranged by the anglular order of eigenvectors and identified few correlated variables  (see \ref{matrix}, and see \ref{fig:matrixfull} for the full correlation values). In our correlation matrix analysis, we observed a few relationships that may be meaningful. We found turbidity positively correlated with orthophosphate, total phosphorus, total Kejldahl nitrogen, water temperature, phycocyaninin and chloraphyll. Chlorophyll is positively correlated with \emph{mcye}, phycocyanin, \emph{16S rRNA}, total Kejldahl nitrogen and orthophosphate. Conductance was found to have negative relationship with precipitation.
Developed land-use is positively correlated with nitrate+nitrite, total nitrogen and conductance.
Watershed area was positive correlated with Zebra mussel mass.
Agriculture had a positive relationship with nitrate+nitrite,
Forest land-use had negative correlation with total Kejldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, conductivity, ammonia, nitrate+nitrite and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio.
Precipitation had negative correlation with total nitrogen, orthophosphate and conductivity.

\subsection{Feature Selection}

From our best subset analysis with the largest subset size of 3 (nvmax=3),  orthophosphate, \emph{mcyE}, turbidity, max depth,  lake area to watershed ratio, barren land-use and precipitation 3 days prior to sampling were frequently chosen  predictor variables for MC concentration (see figure \ref{subset}).


%Proper way to assess collinearity by linear regression? A caused by B and B caused by A?
From our data, $log10$(Orthophosphate) was shown to be positively correlated with $log10$(turbidity) from our exploratory analysis, with a simple linear regression analysis, the relationship is slightly significant ($\beta=0.57$, $F_{{1,26}}=3.13$, $p=0.08$). The regression did have outliers, with the two data points removed the relationship is significant ($\beta=0.17$, $F_{{1,25}}$, $p=0.01$) (see \ref{fig:plot1}). We avoid including either $log10$(orthophosphate) or $log10$(turbidity) in our models together.
%All other variables did not have any significant correlations with eachother.
%From backward stepwise regression, eliminated  contained 3 variables, orthophosphate, max depth and turbidity.
With $log10$(\emph{mcyE}) as a single predictor in a linear mixed model shown to have a significant relationship with $log10$(MC), however we are missing data from July ($N=91$) which does not allow us to use the full dataset ($\beta=0.15$, $F_{{1,72}}$, $p=0.002$).

We found $log10$(turbidity) as the best single predictor. The relationship was significant with predicting $log9$(MC) concentration in a linear mixed-effect model ($\beta=0.55$, $F_{{1,27}}=5.90$, $p=0.02$) (see \ref{fig:plot2}). However, with $log10$(orthophosphate) as a single predictor the relationship is almost significant ($\beta=0.35$, $F_{{1,26}}=3.13$, $p=0.07$) (see \ref{fig:plot2}).  The best model for predicting MC is turbidity as the sole predictor. Adding additional predictors did not significantly improve the model.

For predicting the $log10$(\emph{16s rRNA}) gene copies, chloraphyll, agriculture land-use and average temperature 3 and 30 days prior to sampling and precipitation 5 days before sampling were investigated for building our model (see figure \ref{subset2}). Precipitation and temperature data did not have significant relationship and was eliminated from the model. Agriculture percent land-use found to be the best predictor for \emph{16s rRNA} ($\beta=0.70$, $F_{{1,26}}=5.10$, $p=0.03$)(figure \ref{fig:agriculture})

\subsection{Discussions}

Comparing the results between MC concentrations and \emph{16s rRNA}, we can see a difference in figure \ref{fig:resbar}.
Lake turnover, winter stable, spring mix, summer stable, fall mix. 
Microcystin concentration tells a different story compared to \emph{16s rRNA}. This curve is to be expected due to warmer temperature as our data does follow this pattern (see figure \ref{fig:hobo}).

In our first hypothesis, I wanted test if disturbance from developed land is associated with \gls{hab} and if it has an affect on nutrient concentration.  From our data, we did not find a significant relationship between developed land use and MC concentrations or \emph{16s rRNA}. However, we did find developed land use having some effect with nitrate+nitrite.

Forest has negative correlation with NUTRIENTS

Disturbances of flora contributes to lower nutrient retention and hydrological impacts that can cause more blooms \cite{anderson_harmful_2002, codd_cyanobacterial_2000, fraterrigo_influence_2008}.
\gls{mc} could increase as developed is more prevalent in the lake's watershed.


Bioavailability of phosphorus is pH dependent, where most is available between when in alkaline conditions greater \cite{lucas_relationships_1961}.
Mostly all of our sampled lakes were mostly alkaline conditions averaging around 8.53$\pm$0.37 pH ranging from 7.44 to 9.94.

Wixom lake is very unique, it has the largest watershed amongst all our surveyed lake and has visually one of the largest extent


%Dissolved oxygen averaged around 12.98$\pm$20.8 mg/L of \ch{O2}.

% FORMS OF NUTRIENTS TODO revise this, expand it
In controlled lab experiments, nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen or phosphorus are found to be limiting growth factors. In a  when \emph{Microcystis aereginosa} grown in the laboratory \cite{xiao_colony_2018, yema_role_2016}.

% revise this and put more work into this TODO
Cyanobacteria are versatile as they can acquire nutrients under extreme conditions. They can utilize a process called quorom sensing which they coordinate with each other by using a signaling hormone acylated homoserine lactones \cite{van_mooy_quorum_2012}. They also can create a network of cells which work together as a unit, often as seen as a layer of green goo floating on top of water.  There are very robust organisms, as some can change their buoyancy by modulating the intracellular gas vesicles gives them a competitive advantage over other species for seeking light \cite{feng_how_2018}.\emph{Microcystis} can form a complex colony made by a mucilage structure which can be bouyant due to high concentration of dissolved oxygen \cite{xiao_colony_2018}. % TODO expand how co2 gets pumped into gas vesicles
Most of the cyanotoxin are intracellular, however with increase turbulence from wind and precipitation can release more toxins due to cell lysis either from cell apoptosis or from mechanical abruption which release \cite{rohrlack_fate_2007}. % TODO cyanophages, viruses 



%A study in South Korea found 3-week lagged water temperature,dissolved oxygen and pH with to correlate with each other in their models \cite{ahn_evaluation_2011}.

%Growing cyanobacteria measurements taken at the same time . Their is an assumption being made.

%Total nitrogen was found to explain the variance of MC concentrations \cite{taranu_predicting_2017}.

%Man-made lakes are found to be twice as higher concentrations in cylindrospermonsin \cite{loftin_cyanotoxins_2016}.


%Low-nutrient lakes can still exhibit blooms.
 %This can complicate our model as this is not accounted for.

%QPCR results as a response variable comes with complication as this does not distinguish alive or dead cyanobacteria.




%Water sampling for nutrient is difficult. Time series data, nutrient dynamic. Continuous measurements  water data would be best, but for a large survey its almost impractical. Other organisms compete with these common nutrients. Aquatic macrophytes largely acquire dissolved phosphorus. Time between sampling the lake at the peak of the bloom and the flush of nutrient inputs can be lagged, and most likely different depending on each lakes morphology. Biological properties are not necessarily linear. One thing to consider here is the sampling frequency. We sampled once a month for four months, which gives four sampling results for each lake. This may not explain everything about each lake.

% How pH and DO has an influence on nutrient availability
