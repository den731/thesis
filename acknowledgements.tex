I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. David Szlag, for providing me the opportunity to grow my laboratory and critical thinking skills. I also would like to thank Dr. Raffel for his critique and guidance of our research work. I want to give special thanks to Dr. David Newlin and Dr. Linda Schweitzer who have personally helped me push along my graduate program and gave me hope to strive on. I am grateful to have worked with Dr. Annie Ettinger who has brought  endless laughter in the lab. I also would like to thank the staff of Oakland University Chemistry Department.   
I am thankful for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for funding this research (grant \# 36636). I am eternally grateful to have work with Brian Spies and Andrew Herppich for aiding me in the chemical analysis on our collected samples and managing the project. I am also grateful of Ryan Mcwhinnie and Jason Sckrabulus for working on the lake sampling, coordinating with the volunteers and mussel counts. And finally, I would like to thank my dear friends who has tremendously helped me survive through the doldrums.
