	abstract = {Research and therapeutic targeting of the phosphoserine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A is hindered by the lack of selective inhibitors. The microcystin (MC) natural toxins target both phosphatases with equal potency, and their complex synthesis has complicated structure-activity relationship studies in the past. We report herein the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of 11 MC analogues, which was accomplished through an efficient strategy combining solid- and solution-phase approaches. Our approach led to the first MC analogue with submicromolar inhibitory potency that is strongly selective for PP2A over PP1 and does not require the complex lipophilic Adda group. Through mutational and structural analyses, we identified a new key element for binding, as well as reasons for the selectivity. This work gives unprecedented insight into how selectivity between these phosphatases can be achieved with MC analogues.},

Microcystin and cyanopeptolin contents varied by a factor 2-3, whereas the anabaenopeptins and anabaenopeptilides of Anabaena varied more strongly. Under phosphorus limitation, peptide production rates increased with the specific growth rate. The response of peptide production to light intensity and temperature was more complex: in many cases peptide production decreased with specific growth rate. We observed compensatory changes of different peptide variants: decreased cyanopeptolin A and C contents were accompanied by increased cyanopeptolin 970 contents, and decreased anabaenopeptin A and C contents were accompanied by increased anabaenopeptilide 90B contents. Compensatory dynamics in peptide production may enable cyanobacteria to sustain stable peptide levels in a variable environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial secondary metabolites have attracted increasing scientific interest due to bioactivity of many compounds in various test systems. Among the known structures, oligopeptides are often found with many congeners sharing conserved substructures, while being highly variable in others. A major part of known oligopeptides are of non-ribosomal origin and can be grouped into classes with conserved structural properties. Thus, the overall structural diversity of cyanobacterial oligopeptides only seemingly suggests an equally high diversity of biosynthetic pathways and respective genes. For each class of peptides, some of which have been found in all major branches of the cyanobacterial evolutionary tree, homologous synthetases and genes can be inferred. This implies that non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes are a very ancient part of the cyanobacterial genome and presumably have evolved by recombination and duplication events to reach the present structural diversity of cyanobacterial oligopeptides. In addition, peptide synthetases would appear to be an essential part of the cyanobacterial evolution and physiology. The present review presents an overview of the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial peptides and corresponding gene clusters, the structural diversity of structural types and structural variations within peptide classes, and implications for the evolution and plasticity of biosynthetic genes and the potential function of cyanobacterial peptides.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are a group of cyclic peptides which are commonly produced by freshwater cyanobacteria and are harmful to humans and other animals when ingested. As the toxicity of microcystins varies according to their structure, it is important to understand the environmental variables which influence microcystin congener abundance. Because of the differential levels of nitrogen in amino acids incorporated into microcystins, nitrogen concentration might play an important role. During this study, Microcystis CAWBG11 was grown in batch culture until nitrogen-deplete. Over the duration of the study, the relative abundance of the microcystin congeners present shifted. The relative abundance of the arginine-containing microcystins decreased, whilst the congeners which did not contain arginine increased. These changes coincided with a large decrease in nitrate concentration to 0.35 \% of initial levels. Linear regression of log(10) microcystin content and nitrate concentration revealed slopes which were dependent upon the number of arginine residues present in the toxin. This modulation in microcystin congener relative abundance was likely to be due to scarcity of the nitrogen-rich arginine during periods of nitrogen limitation. During the experimental period the relative abundance of congeners with a single arginine residue at position-2 did not change (p {\textgreater} 0.05), whilst the relative abundance of the congeners with a position-4 arginine decreased significantly (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001). Our results suggested that there arginine in the microcystin structure may be selectively modulated. Furthermore, the relative toxicity of the nitrogen-depleted culture was found to be reduced (15 \% lower) compared with the starting culture.},

We collected sediment cores from 17 reservoirs in the Central Plains region of the USA, and we measured nutrient release rates under anoxic conditions in laboratory incubation studies. We used corresponding landuse and water-quality data from the reservoirs to develop regression models for predicting P release rates. We used variables that relate directly to trophic state, including \% cropland in the watershed, which explained the greatest amount of variation in release rates. P release rates tended to be higher in reservoirs that had greater \% cropland in the watersheds. We developed additional predictive models using surface total P concentrations and Secchi disk depths. Trophic state was also a good predictor of release rates because more P was released from hypereutrophic reservoirs than from mesotrophic or eutrophic reservoirs. The median release rates for reservoirs representing different trophic state classes (e.g., mesotrophic, eutropbic, and hypereutrophic) were very similar to those previously reported for natural lakes. Our models can be used to predict sediment release rates in individual reservoirs of concern or to screen a large number of reservoirs to help direct resources to those systems that are most vulnerable to internal loading. Models based on landuse characteristics are particularly valuable because these data can be obtained from computer-based assessments and do not require labor-intensive field sampling.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton use light for photosynthesis, and the light flux decreases with depth. As a result of this simple light dependence, reaction-advection-diffusion models describing the dynamics of phytoplankton species contain an integral over depth. That is, models that simulate phytoplankton dynamics in relation to mixing processes generally have the form of an integro-partial differential equation (integro-PDE). Integro-PDEs are computationally more demanding than standard PDEs. Here, we outline a reliable and efficient technique for numerical simulation of integro-PDEs. The simulation technique is illustrated by several examples on the population dynamics of sinking phytoplankton, using both single-species models and competition models with several phytoplankton species. Our results confirm recent findings that Sverdrup's critical-depth theory breaks down if turbulent mixing is reduced below a critical turbulence. In fact, our results show that suitable conditions for bloom development of sinking phytoplankton depend on a number of critical parameters, including a minimal depth of the thermocline, a maximal depth of the thermocline, a minimal turbulence, and a maximal turbulence. We therefore conclude that models that do not carefully consider the population dynamics of phytoplankton in relation to the turbulence structure of the water column may easily lead to erroneous predictions.

Numerous hypotheses and descriptive frameworks have been proposed in the literature in an attempt to account for the patterns in phytoplankton community structure that we observe in lakes. Resource-ratio theory is prominent among these competing frameworks. However, because it is equilibrium-based, resource-ratio theory has drawn considerable criticism as a basis for describing and predicting the trends in phytoplankton species composition that occur in natural aquatic ecosystems. BULGAKOV \& LEVICH (1999) have provided evidence that is broadly consistent with this theory. We present here a much broader review of some of the evidence supporting the resource-ratio hypothesis of phytoplankton community structure.

	abstract = {Climate change scenarios predict a doubling of the atmospheric CO(2) concentration by the end of this century. Yet, how rising CO(2) will affect the species composition of aquatic microbial communities is still largely an open question. In this study, we develop a resource competition model to investigate competition for dissolved inorganic carbon in dense algal blooms. The model predicts how dynamic changes in carbon chemistry, pH and light conditions during bloom development feed back on competing phytoplankton species. We test the model predictions in chemostat experiments with monocultures and mixtures of a toxic and non-toxic strain of the freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The toxic strain was able to reduce dissolved CO(2) to lower concentrations than the non-toxic strain, and became dominant in competition at low CO(2) levels. Conversely, the non-toxic strain could grow at lower light levels, and became dominant in competition at high CO(2) levels but low light availability. The model captured the observed reversal in competitive dominance, and was quantitatively in good agreement with the results of the competition experiments. To assess whether microcystins might have a role in this reversal of competitive dominance, we performed further competition experiments with the wild-type strain M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 and its mcyB mutant impaired in microcystin production. The microcystin-producing wild type had a strong selective advantage at low CO(2) levels but not at high CO(2) levels. Our results thus demonstrate both in theory and experiment that rising CO(2) levels can alter the community composition and toxicity of harmful algal blooms.},

This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) (e.g., Microcystis and Nodularia spp.) capable of producing toxic peptides are found in fresh and brackish water worldwide. These toxins include the microcystin (MC) heptapeptides ({\textgreater}60 congeners) and the nodularin pentapeptides (ca. 5 congeners). Cyanobacterial cyclic peptide toxins are harmful to man, other mammals, birds, and fish. Acute exposure to high concentrations of these toxins causes liver damage, while subchronic or chronic exposure may promote liver tumor formation. The detection of cyclic peptide cyanobacterial toxins in surface and drinking waters has been hampered by the low limits of detection required and that the present routine detection is restricted to a few of the congeners. The unusual beta-amino acid ADDA (4E,6E-3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid) is present in most ({\textgreater}80\%) of the known toxic penta- and heptapeptide toxin congeners. Here, we report the synthesis of two ADDA-haptens, the raising of antibodies to ADDA, and the development of a competitive indirect ELISA for the detection of microcystins and nodularins utilizing these antibodies. The assay has a limit of quantitation of 0.02-0.07 ng/mL (depending on which congeners are present), lower than the WHO-proposed guideline (1 ng/mL) for drinking water, irrespective of the sample matrix (raw water, drinking water, or pure toxin in PBS). This new ELISA is robust, can be performed without sample preconcentration, detects toxins in freshwater samples at lower concentrations than does the protein phosphatase inhibition assay, and shows very good cross-reactivity with all cyanobacterial cyclic peptide toxin congeners tested to date (MC-LR, -RR, -YR, -LW, -LF, 3-desmethyl-MC-LR, 3-desmethyl-MC-RR, and nodularin).},

Nearly two thirds (65.8\%) of the samples with microcystin concentrations  1.0 mg/L (n = 126) were limited to three nutrient and water quality-based ecoregions (Corn Belt and Northern Great Plains, Mostly Glaciated Dairy Region, South Central Cultivated Great Plains) in watersheds with strong agricultural influence. canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that both microcystin concentrations and cyanobacteria abundance were positively correlated with total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and temperature; correlations with total phosphorus and water clarity were not as strong.

	abstract = {Although algal blooms, including those considered toxic or harmful, can be natural phenomena, the nature of the global problem of harmful algal blooms (HABs) has expanded both in extent and its public perception over the last several decades. Of concern, especially for resource managers, is the potential relationship between HABs and the accelerated eutrophication of coastal waters from human activities. We address current insights into the relationships between HABs and eutrophication, focusing on sources of nutrients, known effects of nutrient loading and reduction, new understanding of pathways of nutrient acquisition among HAB species, and relationships between nutrients and toxic algae. Through specific, regional, and global examples of these various relationships, we offer both an assessment of the state of understanding, and the uncertainties that require future research efforts. The sources of nutrients potentially stimulating algal blooms include sewage, atmospheric deposition, groundwater flow, as well as agricultural and aquaculture runoff and discharge. On a global basis, strong correlations have been demonstrated between total phosphorus inputs and phytoplankton production in freshwaters, and between total nitrogen input and phytoplankton production in estuarine and marine waters. There are also numerous examples in geographic regions ranging from the largest and second largest U.S. mainland estuaries (Chesapeake Bay and the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuarine System), to the Inland Sea of Japan, the Black Sea, and Chinese coastal waters, where increases in nutrient loading have been linked with the development of large biomass blooms, leading to anoxia and even toxic or harmful impacts on fisheries resources, ecosystems, and human health or recreation. Many of these regions have witnessed reductions in phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) or HAB incidence when nutrient controls were put in place. Shifts in species composition have often been attributed to changes in nutrient supply ratios, primarily N:P or N:Si. Recently this concept has been extended to include organic forms of nutrients, and an elevation in the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON) has been observed during several recent blooms. The physiological strategies by which different groups of species acquire their nutrients have become better understood, and alternate modes of nutrition such as heterotrophy and mixotrophy are now recognized as common among HAB species. Despite our increased understanding of the pathways by which nutrients are delivered to ecosystems and the pathways by which they are assimilated differentially by different groups of species, the relationships between nutrient delivery and the development of blooms and their potential toxicity or harmfulness remain poorly understood. Many factors such as algal species presence/abundance, degree of flushing or water exchange, weather conditions, and presence and abundance of grazers contribute to the success of a given species at a given point in time. Similar nutrient loads do not have the same impact in different environments or in the same environment at different points in time. Eutrophication is one of several mechanisms by which harmful algae appear to be increasing in extent and duration in many locations. Although important, it is not the only explanation for blooms or toxic outbreaks. Nutrient enrichment has been strongly linked to stimulation of some harmful species, but for others it has not been an apparent contributing factor.
The overall effect of nutrient over-enrichment on harmful algal species is clearly species specific.},

	abstract = {Nutrient loading to lakes depends on both the availability of nutrients in a watershed and their potential for movement to a lake. Many studies have demonstrated that variation in watershed land use can translate to differences in lake water quality by affecting nutrient availability. There have been few attempts, however, to understand how loading to surface waters is affected by land use when there are differences in watershed transport capacity. We compared the relationship between land use/cover and lake nutrients in lakes draining watersheds that exhibited high and low transport capacity using a 5 year (2001-2005) dataset describing the chemistry of 101 lakes and reservoirs in a region of intensive agriculture. We measured watershed transport capacity by compositing the hydrologic, geologic, and topographic variables correlated with interannual variability in lake total nitrogen (TN) or phosphorus (TP) because the hydrologic permeability of watersheds amplifies downstream responses to rainfall events. Factors describing watershed transport capacity differed for TN and TP, consistent with differences in nutrient mobility and biogeochemistry. Partial least squares regression revealed that watershed transport capacity influenced the nature of the association between land use/cover and lake chemistry. In watersheds with low transport capacity, in-lake processes and near-shore land use/cover tended to be more influential, whereas, in watersheds with high transport capacity, land use/cover across the entire watershed was important for explaining lake chemistry. Thus, although land use is a key driver of nutrient loading to lakes, the extent to which it influences water quality can vary with watershed transport capacity.},

A recent update of the Contaminant Candidate List focuses research and data collection on the cyanotoxins microcystin LR, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin. Liquid Chromatography/Tandem-Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is a powerful tool for the analysis of various analytes in a wide variety of matrices because of its sensitivity and selectivity. The use of smaller column media (sub 2 microm particles) was investigated to both improve the speed, sensitivity and resolution, and to quantify the CCL cyanotoxins, in a single analysis, using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) combined with tandem mass spectrometry. Natural waters and spiked samples were analyzed to show proof-of-performance. The presented method was able to clearly resolve each of the cyanotoxins in less than eight minutes with specificity and high spike recoveries.},

By means of a surface barostat technique it was shown that the membrane penetrating capacity (surface activity) of microcystin-LR was low, indicating that the toxin requires an active uptake mechanism. The hepatocellular uptake of microcystin-LR could be inhibited in the presence of bile acid transport inhibitors such as antamanide (5 microM), sulfobromophthalein (50 microM) and rifampicin (30 microM). The uptake was also reduced in a concentration dependent manner when the hepatocytes were incubated in the presence the bile salts cholate and taurocholate. A complete inhibition of the hepatocellular uptake was achieved by 100 microM of either bile salt. The overall results indicate that the uptake of microcystin-LR is through the multispecific transport system for bile acids.

	abstract = {Harmful (toxic, food web altering, hypoxia generating) cyanobacterial algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are proliferating world-wide due to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, and they represent a serious threat to the use and sustainability of our freshwater resources. Traditionally, phosphorus (P) input reductions have been prescribed to control CyanoHABs, because P limitation is widespread and some CyanoHABs can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N(2)) to satisfy their nitrogen (N) requirements. However, eutrophying systems are increasingly plagued with non N(2) fixing CyanoHABs that are N and P co-limited or even N limited. In many of these systems N loads are increasing faster than P loads. Therefore N and P input constraints are likely needed for long-term CyanoHAB control in such systems. Climatic changes, specifically warming, increased vertical stratification, salinization, and intensification of storms and droughts play additional, interactive roles in modulating CyanoHAB frequency, intensity, geographic distribution and duration. In addition to having to consider reductions in N and P inputs, water quality managers are in dire need of effective tools to break the synergy between nutrient loading and hydrologic regimes made more favorable for CyanoHABs by climate change. The more promising of these tools make affected waters less hospitable for CyanoHABs by 1) altering the hydrology to enhance vertical mixing and/or flushing and 2) decreasing nutrient fluxes from organic rich sediments by physically removing the sediments or capping sediments with clay. Effective future CyanoHAB management approaches must incorporate both N and P loading dynamics within the context of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes associated with climate change.},

In recent years, the rapid progress in generating and characterizing mice with targeted deletion of transporters has greatly increased our knowledge of the functions of transporters in the pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics of xenobiotics. In this introduction, we focus on functions of transporters learned from experiments on knockout mice as well as humans and rodents with natural mutations of these transporters. We limit our discussion to transporters that either directly transport xenobiotics or are important in biliary excretion or cellular defenses, namely multidrug resistance, multidrug resistance-associated proteins, breast cancer resistance protein, organic anion transporting polypeptides, organic anion transporters, organic cation transporters, nucleoside transporters, peptide transporters, bile acid transporters, cholesterol transporters, and phospholipid transporters, as well as metal transporters. Efflux transporters in intestine, liver, kidney, brain, testes, and placenta can efflux xenobiotics out of cells and serve as barriers against the entrance of xenobiotics into cells, whereas many xenobiotics enter the biological system via uptake transporters. The functional importance of a given transporter in each tissue depends on its substrate specificity, expression level, and the presence/absence of other transporters with overlapping substrate preferences. Nevertheless, a transporter may affect a tissue independent of its local expression by altering systemic metabolism. Further studies on the gene regulation and function of transporters, as well as the interrelationship between transporters and phase I/II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, will provide a complete framework for developing novel strategies to protect us from xenobiotic insults.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether concentrations of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin were positively associated with Dreissena polymorpha invasion by conducting surveys of 39 inland lakes in southern Michigan with low to moderate total phosphorus concentrations ({\textless}= 20 mu gL(-1)). Lakes with D. polymorpha had 3.3 times higher microcystin concentrations and 3.6 times higher biomass of Microcystis aeruginosa (a major producer of microcystin) than comparable lakes without D. polymorpha. In contrast, the biomass of Anabaena spp. (another potential producer of microcystin) was 4.6 times higher in lakes without D. polymorpha. We also conducted a large-scale enclosure manipulation of D. polymorpha density in Gull Lake, a low-nutrient lake containing D. polymorpha. The experiment revealed a positive effect of D. polymorpha on microcystin concentrations and M. aeruginosa biomass. The congruence between survey and experimental results provides strong evidence that D. polymorpha invasion causes an increase in toxin concentrations in lakes with low to moderate nutrients. An increase in M. aeruginosa biomass may negatively impact food webs and public health because microcystins are known to be toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms.},

Water and mussels collected from two eutrophic sites were incubated in an outdoor ''natural light'' incubator at ambient temperature for 24 hours. Experiments were conducted in 4-L bottles with screened (40 or 53-mu m net) or unscreened water and with and without mussels. Despite relatively high growth rates of protozoa on both dates, mussels lowered protozoan numbers by 70-80\% and reduced the species richness of the protozoan community by 30-50\%. Large heterotrophic flagellates were reduced up to 100\% while peritrichous ciliates attached to the colonies of blue-greens were reduced only by 50\%. Dreissena selectively removed nanoplanktonic Cryptomonas and Cyclotella, but had no significant effect on the predominant phytoplankton species, Microcystis. Overall, Dreissena clearance rates were low in the presence of this cyanophyte species. We conclude that zebra mussels, in regions where they are abundant, can cause significant changes in composition of both the protozoan and phytoplankton communities.},

	abstract = {The cyanobacteria are a phylum of bacteria that have played a key role in shaping the Earth's biosphere due to their pioneering ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Throughout their history, cyanobacteria have experienced major biogeochemical changes accompanying Earth's geochemical evolution over the past 2.5+ billion years, including periods of extreme climatic change, hydrologic, nutrient and radiation stress. Today, they remain remarkably successful, exploiting human nutrient over-enrichment as nuisance "blooms." Cyanobacteria produce an array of unique metabolites, the functions and biotic ramifications of which are the subject of diverse ecophysiological studies. These metabolites are relevant from organismal and ecosystem function perspectives because some can be toxic and fatal to diverse biota, including zooplankton and fish consumers of algal biomass, and high-level consumers of aquatic food sources and drinking water, including humans. Given the long history of environmental extremes and selection pressures that cyanobacteria have experienced, it is likely that that these toxins serve ecophysiological functions aimed at optimizing growth and fitness during periods of environmental stress. Here, we explore the molecular and ecophysiological mechanisms underlying cyanotoxin production, with emphasis on key environmental conditions potentially controlling toxin production. Based on this information, we offer potential management strategies for reducing cyanotoxin potentials in natural waters; for cyanotoxins with no clear drivers yet elucidated, we highlight the data gaps and research questions that are still lacking. We focus on the four major classes of toxins (anatoxins, cylindrospermopsins, microcystins and saxitoxins) that have thus far been identified as relevant from environmental health perspectives, but caution there may be other harmful metabolites waiting to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {Microcystis aeruginosa, a primary species in cyanobacterial blooms, is ubiquitously distributed in water. Microcystins (MCs) purified from M. aeruginosa can exert reproductive toxicity in fish. However, the effects of M. aeruginosa at environmentally relevant levels on the reproductive and endocrine systems of zebrafish are still unknown. The present study investigated the reproductive and endocrine-disrupting toxicity of M. aeruginosa on female zebrafish (Danio rerio) by short-term exposure (96 h). After exposure, marked histological lesions in the liver or gonads, such as nuclear pyknosis and deformation, were observed, and the fertilization rate and hatchability of eggs spawned from treated females were both significantly lower than they were in females in the control group, suggesting the possibility of trans generational effects of M. aeruginosa exposure. Moreover, M. aeruginosa exposure decreased the concentration of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in female zebrafish. Interestingly, the vtg1 transcriptional level significantly decreased in the liver, whereas plasma vitellogenin (VTG) protein levels increased. The present findings indicate that M. aeruginosa could modulate endocrine function by disrupting transcription of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver (HPGL) axis-related genes, and impair the reproductive capacity of female zebrafish, suggesting that M. aeruginosa causes potential adverse effects on fish reproduction in Microcystis bloom-contaminated aquatic environments.

Results were consistent with the hypothesis that zebra mussels promoted blooms of toxic M. aeruginosa in Saginaw Bay, western Lake Erie, and other lakes through selective rejection in pseudofeces. Mussels exhibited high feeding rates similar to those seen for a highly desirable food alga (Cryptomonas) with both large ( {\textgreater} 53 mum) and small ({\textless} 53 mum) colonies of a nontoxic and a toxic laboratory strain of M. aeruginosa known to cause blockage of feeding in zooplankton. In experiments with naturally occurring toxic M. aeruginosa from Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie and a toxic isolate from Lake Erie, mussels exhibited lowered or normal filtering rates with rejection of M. aeruginosa in pseudofeces. Selective rejection depended on "unpalatable" toxic strains of M. aeruginosa occurring as large colonies that could be rejected efficiently while small desirable algae were ingested.},

The M. aeruginosa release toxic microcystins that can create a wide range of health-related issues to aquatic animals and humans. It is essential to eliminate them from the ecosystem with convenient method. It has been reported that engineered metal nanoparticles are potentially toxic to pathogenic organisms. In the present study, we examined the growth inhibition effect of green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles against M. aeruginosa. The green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles exhibit an excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 270 nm confirmed using UV-visible spectrophotometer. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that synthesized nanoparticles are colloidal in nature and having a particle size of 551 nm with high stability at -26.6 mV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that copper oxide nanoparticles are spherical, rod and irregular in shape, and consistently distributed throughout the solution. The elemental copper and oxide peak were confirmed using energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicates the presence of functional groups which is mandatory for the reduction of copper ions. Besides, green synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles shows growth inhibition against M. aeruginosa. The inhibition efficiency was 31.8 \% at lower concentration and 89.7 \% at higher concentration of copper oxide nanoparticles, respectively. The chlorophyll (a and b) and carotenoid content of M. aeruginosa declined in dose-dependent manner with respect to induction of copper oxide nanoparticles. Furthermore, we analyzed the mechanism behind the cytotoxicity of M. aeruginosa induced by copper oxide nanoparticles through evaluating membrane integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) level. The results expose that there is a loss in membrane integrity with ROS formation that leads to alteration in the Deltapsim, which ends up with severe mitochondrial injury in copper oxide nanoparticles treated cells. Hence, green way synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles may be a useful selective biological agent for the control of M. aeruginosa.},

	abstract = {To examine the hypothesis that invasion by zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) promotes phytoplankton dominance by the noxious cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, 61 Michigan lakes of varying nutrient levels that contain or lack zebra mussels were surveyed during late summer. After accounting for variation in total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, lakes with Dreissena had lower total phytoplankton biomass, as measured by chlorophyll a and algal cell biovolume. Phytoplankton biomass increased with TP in both sets of lakes, although the elevations of the relationship differed. The percentage of the total phytoplankton comprised by cyanobacteria increased with TP in lakes without Dreissena (R-2 = 0.21, P = 0.025) but not in lakes with Dreissena (P = 0.79). Surprisingly, there was a positive influence of Dreissena invasion on Microcystis dominance in lakes with TP {\textless} 25 mug L-1 (P = 0.0018) but not in lakes with TP {\textgreater} 25 mug L-1 (P = 0.86). The finding that Microcystis, a relatively grazing-resistant component of the phytoplankton, was favored by Dreissena in low- but not in high-nutrient lakes is somewhat counterintuitive, but predator-prey models make this prediction in certain cases when the cost for the prey of being consumption resistant is a low maximum population growth rate. This Dreissena-cyanobacteria interaction contradicts well-established patterns of increasing cyanobacteria with nutrient enrichment in north-temperate lakes and suggests that the monitoring and abatement of nutrient inputs to lakes may not be sufficient to predict and control cyanobacterial dominance of Dreissena-invaded lakes.},

	abstract = {A simple and sensitive in situ method for monitoring the occurrence of toxic algal blooms and shellfish contamination events has been developed. The technique involves the passive adsorption of biotoxins onto porous synthetic resin filled sachets (SPATT bags) and their subsequent extraction and analysis. The success of the method is founded on the observation that during algal blooms significant amounts of toxin, including the low polarity lipophilic compounds such as the pectenotoxins and the okadaic acid complex toxins, are dissolved in the seawater. The results of field trials during Dinophysis acuminata and Protoceratium reticulatum blooms are presented. These data prove the concept and demonstrate that the technique provides a means of forecasting shellfish contamination events and predicting the net accumulation of polyether toxins by mussels. As an early warning method it has many advantages over current monitoring techniques such as shellfish-flesh testing and phytoplankton monitoring. In contrast to the circumstantial evidence provided by genetic probe technologies and conventional phytoplankton monitoring methods, it directly targets the toxic compounds of interest. The extracts that are obtained for analysis lack many of the extraneous lipophilic materials in crude shellfish extracts so that many of the matrix problems associated with chemical and biological analysis of these extracts are eliminated. Analyses can confidently target parent compounds only, because analytical and toxicological uncertainties associated with the multiplicity of toxin analogues produced by in vivo biotransformation in shellfish tissues are reduced. Time integrated sampling provides a good simulation of biotoxin accumulation in filter feeders and the high sensitivity provides lengthy early warning and conservative estimates of contamination potential. The technique may reduce monitoring costs and provide improved spatial and temporal sampling opportunities. When coupled with appropriate analytical techniques (e.g. LC-MS/MS multi-toxin screens, ELISA assays, receptor binding assays), the technique has the potential to offer a universal early warning method for marine and freshwater micro-algae toxins.},

However, despite extensive research during the past four to five decades, many key questions in eutrophication science remain unanswered. Much is yet to be understood concerning the interactions that can occur between nutrients and ecosystem stability: whether they are stable or not, alternate states pose important complexities for the management of aquatic resources. Evidence is also mounting rapidly that nutrients strongly influence the fate and effects of other non-nutrient contaminants, including pathogens. In addition, it will be important to resolve ongoing debates about the optimal design of nutrient loading controls as a water quality management strategy for estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems.},

The fate of non-nutrientcontaminants thus can be strongly influenced by thetrophic state of the waterbodies that receive them: increas-ing supplies of N and P can enhance the biodegradation ofpetrochemicals, aromatic hydrocarbons and pesticides inmany aquatic ecosystems [24]. For example, the rate ofphenol biodegradation increases with the productivity ofthe lake from which the water was taken (Figure 2b).

The results showed that all the tested concentrations of ANT inhibited M. aeruginosa growth significantly except 0.02 mu g/mL ANT in the early stage of the experiment. In the culture media, initially applied ANT concentrations decreased significantly after 3 days of incubation. ANT stimulated MC-LR production in a concentration-dependent manner. After exposure to ANT for 1 day, the expression of mcyB gene was inhibited and the inhibitory effects increased with ANT concentrations. ANT at higher concentrations (above 0.02 mu g/mL) stimulated gene expression of mcyD (P {\textless} 0.05) and mcyH (P {\textless} 0.01) significantly, and 0.02 mu g/mL of ANT inhibited their expression significantly (P {\textless} 0.01). With increasing culture time, 0.18 mu g/mL of ANT inhibited mcyB gene expression first and then stimulated it while gene expressions of mcyD and mcyH were stimulated throughout the experiment. Our results suggested that ANT in natural waters could affect not only Microcystis growth but also MC production via modifying mcy gene expressions.},

We analyzed water, air, and human blood samples for water quality, potential human pathogens, algal taxonomy, and microcystin concentrations. We interviewed study participants for demographic and current health symptom information. Water samples were assayed for potential respiratory viruses (adenoviruses and enteroviruses), but none were detected. We did find low concentrations of Escherichia coli, indicating fecal contamination. We found low levels of microcystins (2 microg/L to 5 microg/L) in the water and ({\textless}0.1 ng/m(3)) in the aerosol samples. Blood levels of microcystins for all participants were below the limit of detection (0.147 microg/L). Given this low exposure level, study participants reported no symptom increases following recreational exposure to microcystins.

Colonies of this alga were initially observed in mid-July, at a time when phosphorus concentration in the lake water had decreased to minimal levels (total P 0.04 mg l(-1)). The P quota of these cells was high (mean concentration 132 mmol kg(-1) dry weight) with a cell P to lake water P concentration ratio of 10(5). The elemental concentrations of Microcystis remained relatively stable throughout the sampling period (July-September), with mean cell concentrations of Mg, P, S and Ca showing no significant changes. Mean elemental ratios and the ratio of monovalent/divalent cations were also relatively constant (SE {\textless} 10\% mean). The pattern of cell elemental associations, determined by Factor and Pearson correlation analysis, was consistent throughout - with Mg, P, K and S forming a core tetrad of inter-correlated elements. The relative constancy of cell composition seen in Microcystis would be expected of an alga with a K-selection strategy. The continued high P quota over a period of nutrient depletion in lake water is consistent with the ability of this alga to sink to nutrient-rich lower regions of the water column.},

	abstract = {In recent years, excessive anthropogenic nutrient loading in Taihu (Lake Tai), China's third largest freshwater lake, has promoted the growth of harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Often composed of toxic species, these blooms threaten the supply of drinking water and fisheries-related food supplies for more than 8 million people. During a spatial survey in May 2009, surface water samples were collected from 14 stations located throughout this 2338 km(2) lake. Physicochemical and toxin measurements were compared to results from PCR based analyses of extracted DNA to examine microbial community diversity. Maximum concentrations of the hepatotoxin microcystin in this region were {\textgreater}600 mu g g(-1) dry weight. Statistical comparisons of lake chemistry demonstrate relationships between toxin concentrations and physicochemistry (e.g., temperature, nutrients) within the water column. Pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed a diverse community that includes potential fecal bacteria. However, subsequent source tracking of specific fecal bacteria (by quantitative PCR) indicated that fecal bacteria concentrations in the lake water bacteria were relatively low and likely not of human origin. In total the data suggest that the proliferation of cyanobacteria, but not the production of microcystin, is influenced (and perhaps regulated) by both nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Our observations further suggest that microcystin concentrations are correlated to the diversity of the eubacterial community, implying that specific bacteria may associate with bloom events and/or be associated with nutrient sources loading into this system.

	abstract = {The increased frequency and intensity of drought with climate change may cause an increase in the magnitude and toxicity of freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs), including Microcystis blooms, in San Francisco Estuary, California. As the fourth driest year on record in San Francisco Estuary, the 2014 drought provided an opportunity to directly test the impact of severe drought on cyanobacteria blooms in SFE. A field sampling program was conducted between July and December 2014 to sample a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at 10 stations in the freshwater and brackish reaches of the estuary. The 2014 Microcystis bloom had the highest biomass and toxin concentration, earliest initiation, and the longest duration, since the blooms began in 1999. Median chlorophyll a concentration increased by 9 and 12 times over previous dry and wet years, respectively. Total microcystin concentration also exceeded that in previous dry and wet years by a factor of 11 and 65, respectively. Cell abundance determined by quantitative PCR indicated the bloom contained multiple potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, toxic Microcystis and relatively high total cyanobacteria abundance. The bloom was associated with extreme nutrient concentrations, including a 20-year high in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and low to below detection levels of ammonium. Stable isotope analysis suggested the bloom varied with both inorganic and organic nutrient concentration, and used ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. Water temperature was a primary controlling factor for the bloom and was positively correlated with the increase in both total and toxic Microcystis abundance. In addition, the early initiation and persistence of warm water temperature coincided with the increased intensity and duration of the Microcystis bloom from the usual 3 to 4 months to 8 months. Long residence time was also a primary factor controlling the magnitude and persistence of the bloom, and was created by a 66\% to 85\% reduction in both the water inflow and diversion of water for agriculture during the summer. We concluded that severe drought conditions can lead to a significant increase in the abundance of Microcystis and other cyanobacteria, as well as their associated toxins.},

To begin to address this data gap, a spatial reconnaissance of fluvial microcystin concentrations was conducted in 75 wadeable streams in the Piedmont region (southeastern USA) during June 2014. Microcystins were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (limit = 0.10 microg/L) in 39\% of the streams with mean, median, and maximum detected concentrations of 0.29 microg/L, 0.11 microg/L, and 3.2 microg/L, respectively. Significant (alpha = 0.05) correlations were observed between June 2014 microcystin concentrations and stream flow, total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio, and water temperature; but each of these factors explained 38\% or less of the variability in fluvial microcystins across the region. Temporal microcystin variability was assessed monthly through October 2014 in 5 of the streams where microcystins were observed in June and in 1 reference location; microcystins were repeatedly detected in all but the reference stream. Although microcystin concentrations in the present study did not exceed World Health Organization recreational guidance thresholds, their widespread occurrence demonstrates the need for further investigation of possible in-stream environmental health effects as well as potential impacts on downstream lakes and reservoirs.

This study was conducted to screen the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuation on phosphorus (P) uptake by Microcystis aeruginosa. Four levels of circumfluence (0, 100, 200, and 300 rpm) and three concentrations of P (0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 mgL(-1)) were used, and the specific growth rate, cell viability, P uptake kinetic, and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) were determined. Results showed that M. aeruginosa had a higher specific growth rate, cell viability, and P uptake rate at low and moderate circumfluence, APA increased with a decrease of the cellular P quota (Q(p)). Turbulence at 300 rpm negatively affected the metabolic activity: the P uptake rate and affinity were reduced significantly (p {\textless} 0.05), APA decreased due to the high Q(p) (p {\textless} 0.05), which led to a decline in the specific growth rate and cell viability. It revealed that hydrodynamics could change P uptake and growth of M. aeruginosa. The P absorption capacity and affinity decreased under high turbulence, which led to the inhibition of cyanobacterial growth. It was deduced that high level of artificial turbulence could be used to decrease the risk of cyanobacterial bloom. On the other hand, increasing additional P loading could enhance the adaptability of M. aeruginosa to turbulence, which weakened the inhibition effect of high turbulence on algal growth, and reduced the effects of artificial turbulence on water bloom.},

	abstract = {A large nation-wide survey of cyanotoxins (1161 lakes) in the United States (U.S.) was conducted during the EPA National Lakes Assessment 2007. Cyanotoxin data were compared with cyanobacteria abundance- and chlorophyll-based World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds and mouse toxicity data to evaluate potential recreational risks. Cylindrospermopsins, microcystins, and saxitoxins were detected (ELISA) in 4.0, 32, and 7.7\% of samples with mean concentrations of 0.56, 3.0, and 0.061mug/L, respectively (detections only). Co-occurrence of the three cyanotoxin classes was rare (0.32\%) when at least one toxin was detected. Cyanobacteria were present and dominant in 98 and 76\% of samples, respectively. Potential anatoxin-, cylindrospermopsin-, microcystin-, and saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria occurred in 81, 67, 95, and 79\% of samples, respectively. Anatoxin-a and nodularin-R were detected (LC/MS/MS) in 15 and 3.7\% samples (n=27). The WHO moderate and high risk thresholds for microcystins, cyanobacteria abundance, and total chlorophyll were exceeded in 1.1, 27, and 44\% of samples, respectively. Complete agreement by all three WHO microcystin metrics occurred in 27\% of samples. This suggests that WHO microcystin metrics based on total chlorophyll and cyanobacterial abundance can overestimate microcystin risk when compared to WHO microcystin thresholds. The lack of parity among the WHO thresholds was expected since chlorophyll is common amongst all phytoplankton and not all cyanobacteria produce microcystins.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are a family of cyclic peptides that are potent inhibitors of the protein phosphatase families PP1 and PP2A. Only three human proteins are thought to be able to mediate the hepatic uptake of microcystins (the organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP1A2), and the predominant hepatic expression of these transporters accounts for the liver-specific toxicity of microcystins. A significant obstacle in the study of microcystins as anticancer drugs is the requirement of specific transport proteins for cellular uptake. We report that OATP1B3 mRNA is up-regulated in non-small cell lung cancer tumors in comparison with normal control tissues. This finding led to the exploration of microcystins as potential anticancer agents. We have developed a HeLa cell model with functional OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 activity. Transiently transfected HeLa cells are over 1,000-fold more sensitive to microcystin LR than the vector-transfected control cells, showing that transporter expression imparts marked selectivity for microcystin cytotoxicity. In addition, microcystin analogues showed variable cytotoxicities in the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-transfected cells, including two analogues with IC(50) values {\textless}1 nmol/L. Cytotoxicity of microcystin analogues seems to correlate to the inhibition of PP2A in these cells and induces rapid cell death as seen by chromatin condensation and cell fragmentation. These studies show that microcystin-induced phosphatase inhibition results in potent cytotoxicity when microcystin compounds can gain intracellular access and are a potent novel class of therapeutic agents for tumors expressing these uptake proteins.},

In an effort to elucidate relationships between microcystin production, genotypic composition of Microcystis community and environmental parameters in a large lake ecosystem, we collected DNA samples and environmental data during a three-year (2003-2005) survey within Lake Erie and used the data to perform a series of correlation analyses. Cyanobacteria and Microcystis genotypes were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Our data show that Microcystis in Lake Erie forms up to 42\% of all cyanobacteria, and that Microcystis exists as a mixed population of potentially toxic and (primarily) non-toxic genotypes. In the entire lake, the total abundance of Microcystis as well as the abundance of microcystin-producing Microcystis is strongly correlated with the abundance of cyanobacteria suggesting that Microcystis is a significant component of the cyanobacterial community in Lake Erie during summer seasons. The proportion of total Microcystis of all cyanobacteria was strongly linked to the microcystin concentrations, while the percentage of microcystin-producing genotypes within Microcystis population showed no correlation with microcystin concentrations. Correlation analysis indicated that increasing total phosphorus concentrations correlate strongly with increasing microcystin concentrations as well as with the total abundance of Microcystis and microcystin-producing Microcystis.

	abstract = {Developing an effective and rapid method to identify and estimate the abundance of Microcystis is warranted in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in view of expanding cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Micro cystis spp. Blooms that occurred in the estuary from July to September 2007 were initially assessed using a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing primers designed for the conserved Microcystis-specific 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. The presence of microcystin-producing (MC+) toxic Micro cystis was observed in cyanobacterial and water samples as shown by the amplification of the MC toxin synthetase genes mcyB and mcyD by standard PCR. The goal of this study was to develop a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on the 16S rDNA and mcyD gene sequences of Microcystis found in the SFE to quantify the proportion of toxic Microcystis with mcyD genes among total Microcystis or cyanobacterial population. Cyanobacterial samples collected by diagonal net tows of the water column showed that the ratio of gene copies was dominant for Microcystis among cyanobacteria (28-96\%), and Microcystis carrying mcyD genes formed 0.4-20\% of the total Micro cystis spp. Total Microcystis was also abundant (7.7 x 10(4) to 9.9 x 10(7) cells L(-1)) in ambient surface waters, and the range of Microcystis cell equivalents with mcyD genes (4.1 x 10(2) to 2.2 x 10(7) cells L(-1)) indicated a large variation in the ratio of toxic Microcystis among total Microcystis (0.01-27\%). Differences in the proportion of toxic and nontoxic Microcystis, as deduced from the cell equivalents of total Micro cystis, were observed across the sampling locations and seasons where concentrations of total MCs (0.007-10.81 mu g/L) also varied. By revealing trends in the sources and magnitude of toxic and nontoxic Microcystis, qPCR can contribute to rapid risk assessment and prediction of strategies designed to manage the adverse effects of cyanobacterial blooms in the SFE.

Therefore, this study attempted to verify the environmental factors related to the dynamics of the abundance of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis in the Daechung Reservoir, Korea. Water samples were collected at weekly intervals from June to October, 2006. Microcystis was a dominant cyanobacterial genus during this period. The proportion of toxic Microcystis genotypes was quantified using a real-time PCR with 2 primer sets for the cpcBA-IGS and mcyJ genes to determine the total Microcystis and potentially toxic genotypes, respectively. Cell densities of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis were strongly related, implying that their growth may be governed by the same environmental factors. Although nontoxic Microcystis was generally dominant over potentially toxic genotypes, the toxic proportion briefly predominated during the Microcystis bloom. While the phosphorus concentration was the fundamental regulating factor for cyanobacterial proliferation, the proportion changes of potentially toxic Microcystis genotypes were more closely related with the water temperature (P {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that eutrophication together with global warming could lead to more frequent toxic blooms.

This work applied qPCR as a tool for early warning of microcystin(MC)-producer cyanobacteria and risk assessment of water supplies. Specific marker genes for cyanobacteria, Microcystis and MC-producing Microcystis, were quantified to determine the genotypic composition of the natural Microcystis population. Correlations between limnological parameters, pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity and MC concentrations as well as Microcystis abundance were assessed. A negative significant correlation was observed between toxic (with mcy genes) to non-toxic (without mcy genes) genotypes ratio and the overall Microcystis density. The highest proportions of toxic Microcystis genotypes were found 4-6 weeks before and 8-10 weeks after the peak of the bloom, with the lowest being observed at its peak. These results suggest positive selection of non-toxic genotypes under favorable environmental growth conditions. Significant positive correlations could be found between quantity of toxic genotypes and MC concentration, suggesting that the method applied can be useful to predict potential MC toxicity risk. No significant correlation was found between the limnological parameters measured and MC concentrations or toxic genotypes proportions indicating that other abiotic and biotic factors should be governing MC production and toxic genotypes dynamics. The qPCR method here applied is useful to rapidly estimate the potential toxicity of environmental samples and so, it may contribute to the more efficient management of water use in eutrophic systems.},

MCs are synthesized non-ribosomally by large multi-enzyme complexes consisting of different modules including polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, as well as several tailoring enzymes. More than 85 different variants of MCs have been reported to exist in nature. These are chemically stable, but undergo bio-degradation in natural water reservoirs. Direct or indirect intake of MCs through the food web is assumed to be a highly exposed route in risk assessment of cyanotoxins. MCs are the most commonly found cyanobacterial toxins that cause a major challenge for the production of safe drinking water and pose a serious threat to global public health as well as fundamental ecological processes due to their potential carcinogenicity. Here, we emphasize recent updates on different modes of action of their possible carcinogenicity. Besides the harmful effects on human and animals, MC producing cyanobacteria can also present a harmful effect on growth and development of agriculturally important plants. Overall, this review emphasizes the current understanding of MCs with their occurrence, geographical distribution, accumulation in the aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems, biosynthesis, climate-driven changes in their synthesis, stability and current aspects on its degradation, analysis, mode of action and their ecotoxicological effects.},

The complete gene cluster encoding the enzymatic machinery required for the biosynthesis of nodularin in N. spumigena strain NSOR10 was sequenced and characterized. The 48-kb gene cluster consists of nine open reading frames (ORFs), ndaA to ndaI, which are transcribed from a bidirectional regulatory promoter region and encode nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules, polyketide synthase modules, and tailoring enzymes. The ORFs flanking the nda gene cluster in the genome of N. spumigena strain NSOR10 were identified, and one of them was found to encode a protein with homology to previously characterized transposases. Putative transposases are also associated with the structurally related microcystin synthetase (mcy) gene clusters derived from three cyanobacterial strains, indicating a possible mechanism for the distribution of these biosynthetic gene clusters between various cyanobacterial genera. We propose an alternative hypothesis for hepatotoxin evolution in cyanobacteria based on the results of comparative and phylogenetic analyses of the nda and mcy gene clusters. These analyses suggested that nodularin synthetase evolved from a microcystin synthetase progenitor. The identification of the nodularin biosynthetic gene cluster and evolution of hepatotoxicity in cyanobacteria reported in this study may be valuable for future studies on toxic cyanobacterial bloom formation. In addition, an appreciation of the natural evolution of nonribosomal biosynthetic pathways will be vital for future combinatorial engineering and rational design of novel metabolites and pharmaceuticals.},

	abstract = {The wide distribution of cyanobacteria in aquatic environments leads to the risk of water contamination by cyanotoxins, which generate environmental and public health issues. Measurements of cell densities or pigment contents allow both the early detection of cellular growth and bloom monitoring, but these methods are not sufficiently accurate to predict actual cyanobacterial risk. To quantify cyanotoxins, analytical methods are considered the gold standards, but they are laborious, expensive, time-consuming and available in a limited number of laboratories. In cyanobacterial species with toxic potential, cyanotoxin production is restricted to some strains, and blooms can contain varying proportions of both toxic and non-toxic cells, which are morphologically indistinguishable. The sequencing of cyanobacterial genomes led to the description of gene clusters responsible for cyanotoxin production, which paved the way for the use of these genes as targets for PCR and then quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thus, the quantification of cyanotoxin genes appeared as a new method for estimating the potential toxicity of blooms. This raises a question concerning whether qPCR-based methods would be a reliable indicator of toxin concentration in the environment. Here, we review studies that report the parallel detection of microcystin genes and microcystin concentrations in natural populations and also a smaller number of studies dedicated to cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin. We discuss the possible issues associated with the contradictory findings reported to date, present methodological limitations and consider the use of qPCR as an indicator of cyanotoxin risk.},

Even with the relatively low isolate survivorship that could select against detecting the full range of genetic variation, populations of M. aeruginosa were genetically diverse within and among lakes (by analysis of molecular variance, Phi(sc) = 0.412 [Phi(sc) is an F-statistic derivative which evaluates the correlation of haplotypic diversity within populations relative to the haplotypic diversity among all sampled populations], P = 0.001), with most clones being distantly related to clones collected from lakes directly attached to Lake Michigan (a Laurentian Great Lake) and culture collection strains collected from Canada, Scotland, and South Africa. Ninety-one percent of the 53 genetically unique M. aeruginosa clones contained the microcystin toxin gene (mcyA).

Cyanobacterial toxins can also be produced by cyanobacteria from terrestrial sources. The range and number of known cyanobacterial toxins are increasing apace as associated poisoning incidents are investigated, and increasingly powerful analytical methods are applied to complement toxicity-based studies on both natural samples and laboratory isolates of cyanobacteria. Water quality management to reduce toxic cyanobacterial mass developments, and schemes to mitigate the potential effects of cyanobacterial toxins, require an understanding of the occurrence and properties of the toxins and of the exposure routes via which the toxins present risks to hearth.

	doi = {10.1016/S0166-445X(99)00079-X},
	abstract = {Numerous cyanobacterial species are capable of producing potent toxins, which have been known to cause intoxications and fatalities in wildlife, livestock and humans. Microcystis is amongst the most ubiquitously distributed blue-green algal genus and almost invariably produces cyclic heptapeptide toxins called microcystins (MC). These toxins are highly persistent in water (several weeks). Highest concentrations are found in shallow littoral areas, the primary environment for aquatic early life-stage development. Therefore, the present study focussed on the potential embryotoxic effects of MC (MC-LR and -RR) in early life-stages of the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The endpoints chosen were mortality, malformation and growth inhibition. To achieve an improved dose-response relationship the uptake of MC was quantified simultaneously, using a radiolabeled derivative of MC-LR. As one of the best described molecular mechanisms of MC toxicity involves the specific inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases-l and -2A (PP), essential enzymes involved in the mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and maintenance of cellular morphology, the inhibition of PP in X. laevis exposed to MC was monitored. For this the presence of both PP-I and PP-2A was confirmed by means of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Second, the capacity of MC to inhibit X. laevis embryo-larval PP was corroborated by in vitro incubation of embryo-larval homogenates with MC-LR and -RR and subsequent determination of PP-inhibition. No increased mortality, malformation; or growth inhibition was observed even at the highest MC concentrations employed. MC had neither a demonstrable inhibitory effect on X. laevis PP-activity in vivo in the first 96 h of exposure. However, as of 96 and 120 h exposure a significant inhibition of PP activity was observed at the highest dose (2000 mu g/l) in MC-LR and MC-RR exposed embryo-larvae, respectively. By the same token, no notable amounts of radiolabeled [H-3]-MC-LR were taken up during the first 96 h, whereas a drastic increase in [H-3]-MC-LR was observed after feeding of the larvae had commenced. The [H-3]-MC-LR concentration was consistently found to be highest in the viscerothoracal sections of the larvae (2112 +/- 429 mu g MC/kg dry weight after 120 h). The present findings indicate that transchorional/transdermal absorption of MC in X. laevis is minimal or absent and that oral uptake of MC with ambient water is necessary for the development of MC related toxicity. Furthermore, the comparison of the MC doses used in this study with the concentrations reported in surface waters indicate that early life-stages of amphibians (up to 5 days of development) are unlikely to be affected by cyanobacterial blooms producing MC-LR and -RR.

By supplying radioactive inorganic carbon to M. aeruginosa cultures and suppressing a considerable production of radioactive microcystin after a certain period of time, an intracellular pool of labelled microcystin was built up. The fate of this pool was studied by following its radioactivity in different time-course experiment. No evidence for losses from the intracellular microcystin pool could be found. All radioactive carbon that had been incorporated into microcystin molecules remained in the intracellular microcystin pool irrespective of whether the cyanobacterial cells were subjected to low light or high light. This suggests that under the conditions tested here, microcystins are not subjects of significant loss processes such as export from the cells or intracellular breakdown. The present study therefore failed to produce evidence for an involvement of microcystins in quorum sensing, defence against epiphytic organisms, or other functions requiring an export of the compounds into the surrounding medium. The lack of an intracellular breakdown suggests that microcystins are not involved in metabolic cellular processes},

through their ability to fix both CO 2 and N 2 , have pivotal roles in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in
these highly nutrient-depleted environments. Trichodesmium colonies host complex consortia of
epibiotic heterotrophic bacteria, and yet, the regulation of nutrient acquisition by these epibionts is
poorly understood. We present evidence that epibiotic bacteria in Trichodesmium consortia use
quorum sensing (QS) to regulate the activity of alkaline phosphatases (APases), enzymes used by
epibionts in the acquisition of phosphate from dissolved-organic phosphorus molecules. A class of
QS molecules, acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), were produced by cultivated epibionts, and
adding these AHLs to wild Trichodesmium colonies collected at sea led to a consistent doubling of
APase activity. By contrast, amendments of (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD)—the
precursor to the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) family of universal interspecies signaling molecules—led to
the attenuation of APase activity. In addition, colonies collected at sea were found by high
performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to contain both AHLs and AI-2. Both types
of molecules turned over rapidly, an observation we ascribe to quorum quenching. Our results
reveal a complex chemical interplay among epibionts using AHLs and AI-2 to control access to

metaorganisms such as corals. In Black Band Disease (BBD), a polymicrobial disease consortium
dominated by the filamentous cyanobacterium Roseofilum reptotaenium displaces members of the
epibiotic microbiome. We examined both normal surface microbiomes and BBD consortia on
Caribbean corals and found that the microbiomes of healthy corals were dominated by Gammapro-
teobacteria, in particular Halomonas spp., and were remarkably stable across spatial and temporal
scales. In contrast, the microbial community structure in black band consortia was more variable and
more diverse. Nevertheless, deep sequencing revealed that members of the disease consortium were
present in every sampled surface microbiome of Montastraea, Orbicella and Pseudodiploria corals,
regardless of the health status. Within the BBD consortium, we identified lyngbic acid, a cyanobacterial
secondary metabolite. It strongly inhibited quorum sensing (QS) in the Vibrio harveyi QS reporters. The
effects of lyngbic acid on the QS reporters depended on the presence of the CAI-1 receptor CqsS.
Lyngbic acid inhibited luminescence in native coral Vibrio spp. that also possess the CAI-1-mediated
QS. The effects of this naturally occurring QS inhibitor on bacterial regulatory networks potentially
contribute to the structuring of the interactions within BBD consortia},

	abstract = {An investigation of three particle-associated microcystin (MC) congeners (MC-LR, MC-RR, and MC-YR) was performed in 2013 from August to November in Hongze Lake, China. All MCs congeners exhibited significant spatial and temporal variability. Particle-associated MCs were commonly found in this lake, but MC-LR was present at low levels (0.075–1.252μg/L). All three MC congeners were found to be significantly correlated with non-toxic phytoplankton (e.g., chlorophyte, cryptophyte and diatoms), while only MC-YR and total MC were correlated with cyanobacteria biomass. Copepods, rotifers and three genera of Cladocera were positively correlated with MC concentrations, but feeding habits of these zooplankton species might have different effects on different MC congeners and total MC distributions. Linear mixed effects (LME) model results showed that the interactions between cyanobacteria and other non-toxic phytoplankton or zooplankton species may drive MCs dynamics. Physiochemical parameters also may affect MC congener variability individually or through their effects on toxic cyanobacteria. The results of this study suggested that MCs distribution in Hongze Lake was site-specific and could be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors both individually and through their interactions.},

	abstract = {The size of the harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie is strongly correlated with agricultural phosphorus (P) loading from tributaries. Despite farmers’ efforts to reduce sediment-bound P loadings and fertilize using current guidance, the media and public have singled them out as the culprit in Lake Erie re-eutrophication. In this paper, two farmer surveys were used to evaluate if farmers in the Lake Erie region follow P fertilizer recommendations, and we also review historic and current P management guidance provided by the scientific community and agricultural industry.The majority (56\% to 80\%) of farmers apply P fertilizers at or below the current fertility recommendations.Wholesale agronomic changes (e.g., no-tillage adoption, crop cultivar advances, and fertilizer application and formulation) have occurred since current fertilizer recommendations were developed. Although crop P uptake mechanisms have not changed, these agronomic changes have altered P cycling in soil and water. Based on these results, it is time that the scientific community and agricultural industry acknowledge that our current guidance may be contributing to eutrophication.We must ask whether or not we have (1) developed appropriate fertility guidance, (2) developed and recommended appropriate practices to protect water quality, (3) adequately considered "the law of unintended consequences" in conservation recommendations, and (4) focused too much on short-term economic outcomes while disregarding environmental quality. Improved understanding, reconsideration of traditional recommendations, and wider farmer adoption of the most effective practices are needed to develop a sustainable agricultural system in the Western Lake Erie Basin that produces needed commodities while preserving ecosystem integrity.},

	abstract = {The global need for accurate and sensitive quantitation of microcystins (MCs) persists as incidents of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms continue to rise and recent research reveals an underestimation of the human health implications of these toxins. An optimal approach for their accurate quantitation relies on the availability of stable isotope-labeled MC standards for use in stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) strategies involving liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Due to the dearth of isotopically labeled MCs, ten different 15N-enriched MCs were biosynthesized from producing cultures and fully characterized. This involved the comparative MS/MS fragmentation of natural abundance or unlabeled metabolites with their 15N-labeled congeners for improved conﬁdence in product ion annotation. These results revealed a series of incorrect annotations described previously in the literature. In this manuscript, the biosynthesis of labeled microcystin is detailed, and their complete analytical characterization for prospective use in targeted SIDA applications, such as routine water testing is described.},

The high irradiance after heavy rainfall provided optimal meteorological conditions for bloom formation during summer, therefore, rain would also appear to forecast imminent bloom. The bloom formation was largely governed by cyanobacteria, in particular, Microcystis spp. and Anabaenaspp. Phycocyanin showed higher correlation with cyanobacteria (r = 0.744, P {\textless} 0.001) compared to chlorophyll-a(r = 0.599, P {\textless} 0.01). Therefore, phycocyanin was more accurate and useful than chlorophyll-a in quantitatively measuring cyanobacterial blooms. The atomic N:P ratio of the particulate form also showed a high correlation with cyanobacteria (r = 0.541, P {\textless} 0.01), increasing from 4.3 to 14.6 during bloom formation, while that of the dissolved form decreased from 25.5 to 8.7. These results indicated that the algae assimilated N significantly without comparable P uptake during the blooming season, which was in sharp contrast to the excessive storage of P during the spring.},

Microcystin, a representative cyanobacterial hepatotoxin, is frequently detected in most Korean lakes and reservoirs. This study developed predictive models for cyanobacterial bloom using artificial neural networks (ANNs; self-organizing map [SOM] and multilayer perceptron [MLP]), including an evaluation of related environmental factors. Fourteen environmental factors, as independent variables for predicting the cyanobacteria density, were measured weekly in the Daechung Reservoir from spring to autumn over 5 years (2001, 2003–2006). Cyanobacterial density was highly associated with environmental factors measured 3 weeks earlier. The SOM model was efficient in visualizing the relationships between cyanobacteria and environmental factors, and also for tracing temporal change patterns in the environmental condition of the reservoir. And the MLP model exhibited a good predictive power for the cyanobacterial density, based on the environmental factors of 3 weeks earlier. The water temperature and total dissolved nitrogen were the major determinants for cyanobacteria. The water temperature had a stronger influence on cyanobacterial growth than the nutrient concentrations in eutrophic waters. Contrary to general expectations, the nitrogen compounds played a more important role in bloom formation than the phosphorus compounds.},

	abstract = {Mass growths of cyanobacteria (blue–green algae), leading to the production of blooms, scums, and mats can occur in nutrient-enriched waterbodies throughout the world. Cyanobacterial mass accumulations attract the attention of water authorities and utilities, environmental and health agencies, and water-user groups, since they present water-treatment, supply, conservation, and health problems. The ability of cyanobacterial populations to produce potent toxins and annual examples of associated human and animal health problems have raised the position of cyanobacteria in the priorities for the management and protection of water quality in countries where health problems associated with the toxins have been perceived. This paper reviews the occurrence of cyanobacterial toxins in waterbodies with examples from national and local surveys. Properties of the known cyanobacterial toxins, associated health problems, and the likelihood of further toxins being discovered are discussed. The need for countermeasures to reduce or prevent the undesirable effects of cyanobacterial toxins exists at several levels. Driving forces influencing the perception of this need and the formulation of management measures include increases in eutrophication increasing demands on diminishing resources for drinking, irrigation, and leisure; and the attention of environmental and health agencies. Health hazards presented by cyanobacterial toxins and derived risk assessments are likely to increasingly influence the ranking of eutrophication problems among water quality issues in drinking and recreational waters.},

	abstract = {Reasons for the emergent interest in HABs are abundant, including concerns associated with human health, adverse effects on biological resources, economic losses attributed to recreation, tourism and seafood related industries, and the cost of maintaining public advisory services and monitoring programs for shellfish toxins and water quality. The impact of HABs can potentially be mitigated by early warning of their development. In this regard the project ASIMUTH (Applied Simulations and Integrated Modelling for the Understanding of Toxic and Harmful algal blooms) was borne in order to develop short term HAB alert systems for Atlantic Europe. This was achieved using information on the most current marine conditions (weather, water characteristics, toxicity, harmful algal presence etc.) combined with high resolution local numerical predictions. This integrated, multidisciplinary, trans-boundary approach to the study of HABs developed during ASIMUTH led to a better understanding of the physical, chemical and ecological factors controlling these blooms, as well as their impact on human activities. The outcome was an appropriate alert system for an effective management of areas that are usually associated with HAB events and where these episodes may have a more significant negative impact on human activities. Specifically for the aquaculture industry, the information provided enabled farmers to adapt their working practices in time to prevent mortalities in finfish farms and/or manage their shellfish harvest more effectively. This paper summarises the modelling and alert developments generated by the ASIMUTH project.},

	abstract = {Coastal waters of the northeastern U.S. are subject to recurrent outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) caused by toxic dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. PSP is not uniform across the large region, but instead reflects Alexandrium growth and toxin accumulation in five separate habitats or zones defined by circulation patterns and the discontinous distribution of the dinoflagellates. Each of these habitats has a unique set of environmental and oceanographic forcings that determine the timing and extent of bloom development and transport and that regulate the extent of genetic exchange with adjacent populations. Several habitats (e.g. the southwestern Gulf of Maine, Massachusetts Bay, and Georges Bank) are linked hydrographically and may share the same Alexandrium population via large-scale transport in a coastal current, whereas the other two habitats (eastern Maine and southern salt ponds-embayments) seem to be isolated and have little or no hydrographic or genetic linkage to adjacent regions during bloom seasons. My paper provides an overview of the regional ecology and oceanography of Alexandrium through a focus on these five subpopulations. Issues that relate to PSP an Alexandrium dynamics throughout the world are highlighted, including species dispersal, the role of cysts and "initiation zones" in bloom development, and the influence of large- and small-scale hydrography on population development and transport. The ability of Alexandrium to colonize multiple habitats and to persist over a large region is emphasized in recognition of the adaptability and resilience of this important organism.},

The specific interest of the study was to test if it is possible to detect nutrient `physiological' or growth (rate) limitation of bacterioplankton and competition for nutrients (N and P) with phytoplankton in generally nutrient rich lake. Thymidine and leucine incorporation; leucine aminopeptidase, β-D-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activity, total count of bacteria, chlorophyll a concentration and primary production as well as the concentrations of different chemical forms of N and P were followed during 4–5 days of the experiment. To address the question of the interactions between nutrients, bacterio- and phytoplankton, experimental and seasonal data sets were included in the analyses. Phosphorus (P) had a positive effect on bacterioplankton in enclosure experiments in June 1997; no effects of nutrients were found in September 1996, while in May 1996, P affected mainly the phytoplankton. On the seasonal scale, the development of bacterioplankton was connected to primary production, total phosphorus and temperature. In enrichment experiments, bacterioplankton was mainly related with primary productivity but the possible importance of bacterial grazers could be presumed. Thus, no evidence was found for nutrient growth limitation and/or competition for N and/or P, rather bacterioplankton depended on organic food supply originating from phytoplankton.},

	abstract = {Background: Blooms of toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) have become increasingly common in the surface waters of the world. Of the known toxins produced by cyanobacteria, the microcystins are the most significant threat to human and animal health. These cyclic peptides are potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein phosphatases type 1 and 2A. Synthesized nonribosomally, the microcystins contain a number of unusual amino acid residues including the β-amino polyketide moiety Adda (3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-4,6-decadienoic acid). We have characterized the microcystin biosynthetic gene cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. Results: A cluster spanning 55 kb, composed of 10 bidirectionally transcribed open reading frames arranged in two putative operons (mcyA–C and mcyD–J), has been correlated with microcystin formation by gene disruption and mutant analysis. Of the 48 sequential catalytic reactions involved in microcystin synthesis, 45 have been assigned to catalytic domains within six large multienzyme synthases/synthetases (McyA–E, G), which incorporate the precursors phenylacetate, malonyl-CoA, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, glutamate, serine, alanine, leucine, D-methyl-isoaspartate, and arginine. The additional four monofunctional proteins are putatively involved in O-methylation (McyJ), epimerization (McyF), dehydration (McyI), and localization (McyH). The unusual polyketide amino acid Adda is formed by transamination of a polyketide precursor as enzyme-bound intermediate, and not released during the process. Conclusions: This report is the first complete description of the biosynthesis pathway of a complex cyanobacterial metabolite. The enzymatic organization of the microcystin assembly represents an integrated polyketide–peptide biosynthetic pathway with a number of unusual structural and enzymatic features. These include the integrated synthesis of a β-amino-pentaketide precursor and the formation of β- and γ-carboxyl-peptide bonds, respectively. Other features of this complex system also observed in diverse related biosynthetic clusters are integrated C- and N-methyltransferases, an integrated aminotransferase, and an associated O-methyltransferase and a racemase acting on acidic amino acids.},

	abstract = {A colorimetric protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPI assay), a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test and different HPLC methods using UV detection were compared for the detection of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, microcystins (MCYST) and nodularin. The suitability of the methods to detect different toxin variants was evaluated by using pure toxins and laboratory cultures as well as water and bloom samples of toxic cyanobacteria. The emphasis of the study was on the analysis of polar demethyl microcystin variants that are common in nature but for which there exist no commercial standards. The IC50 values of MCYST-LR for the PPI assay and the ELISA test were 2.2–2.5 and 0.26–0.38μgl−1, respectively. The most important factors that decreased toxin recovery in sample treatment were the use of C18 cartridges and polypropylene containers. Good recoveries of toxins were obtained by using hydrophilic–lipophilic balanced (Oasis HLB, Waters) cartridges for concentrating the samples. The results obtained with the PPI assay, the ELISA test and HPLC correlated quantitatively well with the exception of [d-Asp3] microcystins. Concentrations of [d-Asp3]MCYST-RR measured with the PPI assay were only 5\% of those obtained by the ELISA test and HPLC. Concentrations of hydrophobic microcystin variants were lower when analysed with ELISA than with the other methods. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set a guideline value of 1μgl−1 for the world-wide most common microcystin variant, MCYST-LR in drinking water. Since the quantitative ranges of the PPI assay and the ELISA test are within microcystin concentrations in natural waters, and both tests are easy to perform, they show potential for routine use in the screening and monitoring of microcystins from drinking water supplies and from recreational waters.},

	volume = {2},
	isbn = {978-94-007-7813-9},
	abstract = {Eutrophication as one of the importunate environmental hazards in the aquatic ecosystems causes pronounced deterioration of the water quality and represents serious threat to the biotic components of this ecosystem. The main environmental effects of eutrophication are increase of suspended particles owing to extensive macroalgal blooms, decrease of water clarity, and increase in the rate of precipitation that led to the destruction of benthic habitat by shading of submerged vegetation. In addition, other important effects are also known such as the bottom-water hypoxia, production of CO2 associating the decomposition of intensive produced organic matter which enhances water acidification, and altering biogeochemical processes, including sediment anoxia, accumulation of deleterious hydrogen sulfide, and nutrient cycling. Shift in the phytoplankton community was frequently reported in numerous eutrophic coastal waters owing to the variable nutrient requirement of different phytoplankton groups and the ratios between the different nutrients in these waters. Eutrophication is often accompanied by algal blooms which are frequently harmful and cause various injuries to the aquatic animals, such as clogging of fish gills, poisoning by toxins secretion, and localized anoxia, which consequently lead to detrimental effect on the fishing resources and the national economy through mass mortality of variable aquatic animals. The hypoxia conditions in bottom waters cause escape of sensitive demersal and other benthic fishes, mortality of bivalves, echinoderms and crustaceans, and extreme loss of benthic diversity, which led to changes in the diet of bottom-feeding fishes as well as shift in dominance among demersal fish species. Increase of algal growth/organic production rates led to changes in the benthic community structure, such as replacement of hermatypic corals with coralline algae, filamentous algae, macroalgae, and/or a variety of filter feeders and increase of bioerosion in some forms. Trophic linkages between pelagic and benthic communities are affected by eutrophication in the coastal waters, where the feeding habit of higher consumers such as benthic fish changes to derive high percentage of their energy from pelagic primary production sources. Shellfishes as an intermediate link between the water column and demersal fish could also be affected by eutrophication and will impact (as prey) on the demersal fish production. Meanwhile, increasing turbidity with eutrophication led to a shift in fish species owing to change of feeding on zooplankton to benthic organisms. Severe shading and light attenuation caused by blooms of both macroalgae and phytoplankton in eutrophic conditions hinder the photosynthetic processes in benthic plants and has led to the decline of seagrass habitats. High nutrient levels may lead to disturbance in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism in seagrass and consequently cause a change in plant communities. Coral reefs are affected by eutrophication in different aspects. The organic compounds released from algal blooms promote microbial activity on coral surfaces and cause coral mortality, while synergistic effect of both the dissolved organic matter and rates of bioerosion has a pronounced role in reef degradation. Harmful algal blooms caused a complete loss of the branching corals, and substantial reductions in the abundance, richness, and trophic diversity of the associated coral reef fish communities. Eutrophication and siltation have severely stressed many fringing and offshore reefs that prefer to grow in nutrient-poor waters, and cause physiological changes in growth and skeletal strength, decrease of reproductive effort, and a reduced ability to withstand disease. In many marine eutrophic habitats, zooplankton community experienced a decline in species richness and abundance, change in structure, size, reproduction rate, and feeding habits. Size change in zooplankton occurs owing to the replacement of small species by another relatively large species of the same group, while the structure may change because of the trophic relationship of zooplankton with their prey (primary producers) and predators (fishes). Although benthic foraminiferans have been widely used as indicators of eutrophication in coastal marine ecosystems, low species diversity and high population densities of several benthic foraminiferans were reported in eutrophic area. On the other hand, smaller opportunistic benthic foraminiferal species dominate in the coral reef ecosystems and lead to a decline of larger endosymbiont-bearing taxa, while the hypoxia-tolerant foraminiferan species increased in abundance against the disappearance of the more sensitive species.},

Three open reading frames (mcyA, mcyB, mcyC) encoding microcystin synthetases were identified in the gene cluster. Sequence analysis indicated that McyA (315 kDa) consists of two modules with an N-methylation domain attached to the first and an epimerization domain attached to the second; McyB (242 kDa) has two modules, and McyC (147 kDa) contains one module with a putative C-terminal thioesterase domain. Conserved amino acid sequence motifs for ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, adenylate formation, and 4'-phosphopantetheine attachment were identified by sequence comparison with authentic peptide synthetase. Insertion mutations in mcyA, generated by homologous recombination, abolished the production of both microcystins in M. aeruginosa K-139. Primer extension analysis demonstrated light-dependent mcy expression. Southern hybridization and partial DNA sequencing analyses of six microcystin-producing and two non-producing Microcystis strains suggested that the microcystin-producing strains contain the mcy gene and the non-producing strains can be divided into two groups, those possessing no mcy genes and those with mcy genes.},

Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways of the toxins has paved the way for the development of molecular techniques for the detection and quantification of the producing cyanobacteria in different environments. Phylogenetic analyses of related clusters from a large number of strains has also allowed for the reconstruction of the evolutionary scenarios that have led to the emergence, diversification and loss of such gene clusters in different strains and genera of cyanobacteria.

	doi = {10.1007/s11120-010-9594-0},
	abstract = {This article examines the geological evidence for the rise of atmospheric oxygen and the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. The evidence for the rise of atmospheric oxygen places a minimum time constraint before which oxygenic photosynthesis must have developed, and was subsequently established as the primary control on the atmospheric oxygen level. The geological evidence places the global rise of atmospheric oxygen, termed the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), between {\textasciitilde}2.45 and {\textasciitilde}2.32 Ga, and it is captured within the Duitschland Formation, which shows a transition from mass-independent to mass-dependent sulfur isotope fractionation. The rise of atmospheric oxygen during this interval is closely associated with a number of environmental changes, such as glaciations and intense continental weathering, and led to dramatic changes in the oxidation state of the ocean and the seawater inventory of transition elements. There are other features of the geologic record predating the GOE by as much as 200-300 million years, perhaps extending as far back as the Mesoarchean-Neoarchean boundary at 2.8 Ga, that suggest the presence of low level, transient or local, oxygenation. If verified, these features would not only imply an earlier origin for oxygenic photosynthesis, but also require a mechanism to decouple oxygen production from oxidation of Earth's surface environments. Most hypotheses for the GOE suggest that oxygen production by oxygenic photosynthesis is a precondition for the rise of oxygen, but that a synchronous change in atmospheric oxygen level is not required by the onset of this oxygen source. The potential lag-time in the response of Earth surface environments is related to the way that oxygen sinks, such as reduced Fe and sulfur compounds, respond to oxygen production. Changes in oxygen level imply an imbalance in the sources and sinks for oxygen. Changes in the cycling of oxygen have occurred at various times before and after the GOE, and do not appear to require corresponding changes in the intensity of oxygenic photosynthesis. The available geological constraints for these changes do not, however, disallow a direct role for this metabolism. The geological evidence for early oxygen and hypotheses for the controls on oxygen level are the basis for the interpretation of photosynthetic oxygen production as examined in this review.},

The objectives of this multi-layer, multi-source database are two fold: ﬁrst, to provide consistent land cover for all 50 States, and second, to provide a data framework which allows ﬂexibility in developing and applying each independent data component to a wide variety of other applications. Components in the database include the following: (1) normalized imagery for three time periods per path/row, (2) ancillary data, including a 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived into slope, aspect and slope position, (3) perpixel estimates of percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy, (4) 29 classes of land cover data derived from the imagery, ancillary data, and derivatives, (5) classiﬁcation rules, conﬁdence estimates, and metadata from the land cover classiﬁcation. This database is now being developed using a Mapping Zone approach, with 66 Zones in the continental United States and 23 Zones in Alaska. Results from three initial mapping Zones show single-pixel land cover accuracies ranging from 73 to 77 percent, imperviousness accuracies ranging from 83 to 91 percent, tree canopy accuracies ranging from 78 to 93 percent, and an estimated 50 percent increase in mapping efﬁciency over previous methods. The database has now entered the production phase and is being created using extensive partnering in the Federal government with planned completion by 2006.},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

Cyanobacterial toxins including microcystins can possibly contaminate these dietary supplements causing hepatotoxicity, tumour formation, and other disorders. The safe use of dietary supplements necessitates the need to assess such toxins in the algal food supplement. The methods which evaluate these dietary supplements should be highly sensitive, cost-effective, and rapid. In this study, multiplex HRM qPCR analysis was used to detect microcystin (MC)-producing cyanobacteria in Spirulina dietary supplements. The multiplex HRM qPCR detection limit was found to be 25 ag of mcyB spiked in a standard concentration of pcb (25 pg). Two distinct melt curves characteristic of pcb (Tm 82.8 ± 0.07 °C) and mcyB (Tm 77.9 ± 0.05 °C) were observed. Microcystin contamination was detected only in the fish food supplements and not in human dietary supplements of Spirulina. Liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed the presence of the congeners of microcystin in the identified positive samples.},

There was virtually no ET, measured by LC–MS, in most tank vegetation (plant, green and red alga). However, ET was detected in a Phormidium sample, a cyanobacterium. In commercial fish feed preparations, ET content increased with the content of cyanobacteria Arthrospira platensis or Arthrospira maxima (Spirulina). High levels of ET (up to 0.8mg per g dry mass) were measured in cyanobacteria preparations sold as dietary supplements for humans and in fresh Scytonema and Oscillatoria cultures. Cyanobacteria contained as much ET as King Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii). All samples with substantial ET content also contained the biosynthesis intermediate hercynine; this strongly suggests that cyanobacteria synthesise ET de novo. In conclusion, our data establish that cyanobacteria can produce high levels of ergothioneine. Spirulina is a novel, safe, accessible, and affordable source of ergothioneine for humans.},

Microcystin analogues targeted were MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-LA, MC-LY, MC-LF, LC-LW, MC-YR, MC-WR, [Asp3] MC-LR, [Dha7] MC-LR, MC-HilR and MC-HtyR. Optimisation studies were conducted to develop a simple, quick and efficient extraction protocol without the need for complex pre-analysis concentration procedures, together with a rapid sub 5min chromatographic separation of toxins in shellfish and algal supplement tablet powders, as well as water and cyanobacterial bloom samples. Validation studies were undertaken on each matrix-analyte combination to the full method performance characteristics following international guidelines. The method was found to be specific and linear over the full calibration range. Method sensitivity in terms of limits of detection, quantitation and reporting were found to be significantly improved in comparison to LC-UV methods and applicable to the analysis of each of the four matrices. Overall, acceptable recoveries were determined for each of the matrices studied, with associated precision and within-laboratory reproducibility well within expected guidance limits. Results from the formalised ruggedness analysis of all available cyanotoxins, showed that the method was robust for all parameters investigated. The results presented here show that the optimised LC-MS/MS method for cyanotoxins is fit for the purpose of detection and quantitation of a range of microcystins and nodularin in shellfish, algal supplement tablet powder, water and cyanobacteria. The method provides a valuable early warning tool for the rapid, routine extraction and analysis of natural waters, cyanobacterial blooms, algal powders, food supplements and shellfish tissues, enabling monitoring labs to supplement traditional microscopy techniques and report toxicity results within a short timeframe of sample receipt. The new method, now accredited to ISO17025 standard, is simple, quick, applicable to multiple matrices and is highly suitable for use as a routine, high-throughout, fast turnaround regulatory monitoring tool.},

The differences that did occur were mostly related to variations in hypolimnion thickness. Changes, if any, in the oxygen depletion rate due to eutrophication are as yet too small to be recognized. Present-day oxygen depletion rates, when corrected for the relatively high temperatures in Lake Erie, are within the range thought to be indicative of mesotrophy in small lakes. The general level of oxygen depletion observed in the Central Basin of Lake Erie is expected on the basis of morphology alone.Key words: Lake Erie, oxygen, hypolimnion, oxygen depletion, trend, Une nouvelle analyse de l'oxygène hypolimnétique dans le bassin central du lac Erié indique que les augmentations historiques de l'épuisement apparent n'étaient pas aussi prononcées qu'on l'avait cru. Les différences qui se sont en fait produites étaient liées surtout aux variations d'épaisseur de l'hypolimnion. Les changements, s'il en est, de taux d'épuisement d'oxygène par eutrophisation sont encore trop faibles pour être identifiables. Les taux actuels d'épuisement d'oxygène, lorsque corrigés pour tenir compte des températures relativement élevées du lac Erié, se situent dans la gamme que l'on considère indicatrice de mésotrophie dans des petits lacs. On peut s'attendre, d'après la seule morphologie du lac, au niveau général d'épuisement d'oxygène observé dans le bassin central du lac Erié.},

	abstract = {Aim Scientists, governments and non-governmental organizations are increasingly moving towards the collection of large, open-access data. In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical “hurdle” model. Location Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127]. Methods We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins. Results Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55\% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26\% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits. Main conclusions Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.},

Molecular biology methods that are based on identification and enumeration of biosynthetic genes, such as quantitative PCR, show promise in this respect. To be practical in a wide range of settings, these methods need to be usable also by laboratory personnel who do not have previous experience in PCR setup. Here we present a real-time quantitative mcyB dry chemistry PCR assay capable of identifying the three globally most common microcystin-producing cyanobacterial genera, Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix. It minimizes the amount of liquid handling and avoids direct contact with the PCR reagents at the time of analysis. Large quantities of virtually identical chips can be manufactured, improving the comparability of results. Using the dry chemistry PCR chips, freshwater environmental samples from Finnish and Estonian lakes, rivers and reservoirs were analyzed for mcyB. The chip format was found to be highly suitable for water sample analysis due to its ease-of-use, good sensitivity and amplification efficiency. Significant positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation, ρ{\textgreater}0.66, P{\textless}0.001) was observed between combined mcyB copy numbers from Microcystis, Anabaena, Planktothrix and total microcystin concentrations, regardless of the method used to measure the toxins (ELISA or LC–MS). Positive correlations were observed also for single lakes.},

The effects of various chemical and physical factors on cell growth and microcystins production were firstly studied in two levels Plackett-Burman design. NaNO3, K2HPO4, iron, light intensity and temperature were screened out to have significant effects (with confidence level above 90\%) on cell growth whereas only NaNO3, iron and light intensity had significant effects on microcystin production. The interactions between the screened variables were then evaluated using central composite design. The analysis of the experimental responses revealed that nitrate and phosphate as well as phosphate and temperature had significant interactive effects on cell growth, respectively, whereas iron and light had significant interactive effect on microcystins production. The critical border values of the variables that may stimulate the rapid growth of Microcystis and microcystin production, when they were simultaneous present in the water, were represented in the second-order polynomial models and determined to be NaNO3 {\textgreater}1.27mM, K2HPO4 {\textgreater}0.1mM, iron {\textgreater}0.01mM, light intensity {\textgreater}26μmolm−2s−1 as well as temperature {\textgreater}18.8°C, respectively.},

However, most evidence for these hypotheses is observational or based on physiological measurements in monocultures. We lack clear experimental evidence relating temperature and nutrients to the competitive success of C. raciborskii. To address this, we performed a 2 × 2 factorial laboratory experiment to study the dynamics of mixed phytoplankton communities subjected to different levels of temperature and phosphorus over 51 days. We allowed C. raciborskii to compete with ten different species from major taxonomic groups (diatoms, green algae, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria) typical of temperate lakes, under low and high summer temperatures (25 and 30 °C) at two levels of phosphorus supply (1 and 25 µmol L−1). Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii dominated the communities and strongly decreased diversity under low-phosphorus conditions, consistent with the hypothesis that it is a good phosphorus competitor. In contrast, it remained extremely rare in high-phosphorus conditions, where fast-growing green algae dominated. Surprisingly, temperature played a negligible role in influencing community composition, suggesting that changes in summer temperature may not be important in determining C. raciborskii’s spread.},

	abstract = {Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are two cyanobacteria species which cause harmful blooms around the world. Both these species share the capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen in heterocytes (cell where fixation occurs). While Dolichospermum can express heterocytes at rather regular intervals across the filament, Cylindrospermopsis can only express heterocytes at the end of the filament. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the role of heterocyte position in the eco-physiological responses of these bloom forming cyanobacteria. Replicated monocultures of each species were grown at different eutrophication scenarios (limiting and sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, in factorial design). Dolichospermum reached high biomass regardless of the nitrogen (and phosphorus) provided, suggesting that this species could bloom in situations with and without nitrogen limitation. In contrast, Cylindrospermopsis reached high biomass only when nitrogen supply was high; its biomass was 15-20 times lower when relying on nitrogen fixation. Hence, despite its ability to fix nitrogen, blooms of Cylindrospermopsis would be expected only under high total nitrogen availability. In Dolichospermum heterocytes occurred only in the scenarios without supplied nitrogen while in Cylindrospermopsis heterocytes occurred regardless of nitrogen availability. Yet, in both species nitrogen fixation occurred (heterocytes were functional) only when nitrogen was limiting, and nitrogen fixation increased significantly at higher phosphorus concentration. Finally, in the absence of supplied nitrogen, filament length in Dolichospermum was the longest, while filaments in Cylindrospermopsis were the shortest (up to 13 times shorter than at nitrogen sufficiency). Therefore, heterocyte expression in Dolichospermum, and filament length in Cylindrospermopsis seem good proxies of nitrogen fixation. The eco-physiological responses recorded here help understand the distribution of these species along nutrient gradients in nature.},

	abstract = {Lake St. Clair is the smallest lake in the Laurentian Great Lakes system. MODIS satellite imagery suggests that high algal biomass events have occurred annually along the southern shore during late summer. In this study, we evaluated these events and tested the hypothesis that summer bloom material derived from Lake St. Clair may enter Lake Erie via the Detroit River and represent an overlooked source of potentially toxic Microcystis biomass to the western basin of Lake Erie. We conducted a seasonally and spatially resolved study carried out in the summer of 2013. Our goals were to: 1) track the development of the 2013 summer south-east shore bloom 2) conduct a spatial survey to characterize the extent of toxicity, taxonomic diversity of the total phytoplankton population and the phylogenetic diversity of potential MC-producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Planktothrix and Anabaena) during a high biomass event, and 3) compare the strains of potential MC-producers in Lake St. Clair with strains from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Our results demonstrated a clear predominance of cyanobacteria during a late August bloom event, primarily dominated by Microcystis, which we traced along the Lake St. Clair coastline downstream to the Detroit River's outflow at Lake Erie. Microcystin levels exceeded the Province of Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (1.5 µg L−1) for safe drinking water at most sites, reaching up to five times this level in some areas. Microcystis was the predominant microcystin producer, and all toxic Microcystis strains found in Lake St. Clair were genetically similar to toxic Microcystis strains found in lakes Erie and Ontario. These findings suggest extensive genetic connectivity among the three systems.},

	title = {A new least impact approach for hydrological conditioning of {DEMs}},
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the primary source for 2D hydrological modelling. Most approaches require a sink-free DEM, because standard flow tracing methods stops at the bottom of sinks. Sinks are commonly removed by sink filling, raising elevation values in the sink to the spill point. This is equivalent to filling a sink with water until the water overflows. The modifications introduced to the DEM by sink filling can be substantial. Sink filling assumes that elevation values are too low, and raises elevation values until the DEM is completely drained. DEMs obtained with remote sensing (radar, LiDAR, stereo imagery) have systematically too high and not too low values. Thus selected elevation values should be lowered rather than raised in order to drain a DEM completely. This method is known as carving, where a channel is carved into the DEM. The minimum impact approach investigates each sink and determines the impact of filling and carving. Each sink is then removed with the method causing less modifications. Here we present a new minimum impact approach that further reduces the amount of modifications. Each sink is removed by a combination of filling and carving. The best combination for a given sink is the combination of filling the sink up to a certain level and carving out a channel from that level that causes the least modifications to the DEM. Flow directions for carving are determined with a least cost path search. We compare the amount of modifications introduced by different methods and the resultant surface flow accumulations. The new method is implemented in the GRASS GIS module r.hydrodem. The hydrologically conditioned DEM can be used with any hydrological modelling software.},

	abstract = {The availability of both global and regional elevation datasets acquired by modern remote sensing technologies provides an opportunity to significantly improve the accuracy of stream mapping, especially in remote, hard to reach regions. Stream extraction from digital elevation models (DEMs) is based on computation of flow accumulation, a summary parameter that poses performance and accuracy challenges when applied to large, noisy DEMs generated by remote sensing technologies. Robust handling of DEM depressions is essential for reliable extraction of connected drainage networks from this type of data. The least-cost flow routing method implemented in GRASS GIS as the module r.watershed was redesigned to significantly improve its speed, functionality, and memory requirements and make it an efficient tool for stream mapping and watershed analysis from large DEMs. To evaluate its handling of large depressions, typical for remote sensing derived DEMs, three different methods were compared: traditional sink filling, impact reduction approach, and least-cost path search. The comparison was performed using the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar for Elevation (IFSARE) datasets covering central Panama at 90 m and 10 m resolutions, respectively. The accuracy assessment was based on ground control points acquired by GPS and reference points digitized from Landsat imagery along segments of selected Panamanian rivers. The results demonstrate that the new implementation of the least-cost path method is significantly faster than the original version, can cope with massive datasets, and provides the most accurate results in terms of stream locations validated against reference points.},

In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

	abstract = {Distribution of cyanobacteria cannot be evaluated using chlorophyll a (Chla) in vivo fluorescence, as most of their Chla is located in non-fluorescing photosystem I. Phycobilin fluorescence, in turn, is noted as a useful tool in the detection of cyanobacterial blooms. We applied phycocyanin (PC) fluorometer in the monitoring of the filamentous cyanobacterial bloom in the Baltic Sea. For the bloom forming filamentous cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Nodularia spumigena, PC fluorescence maximum was identified using the excitation–emission fluorescence matrix. Consequently, the optical setup of our instrument was noted to be appropriate for the detection of PC, and with minor or no interference from Chla and phycoerythrin fluorescence, respectively. During summer 2005, the instrument was installed on a ferryboat commuting between Helsinki (Finland) and Travemünde (Germany), and data were collected during 32 transects providing altogether 200 000 fluorescence records. PC in vivo fluorescence was compared with Chlain vivo fluorescence and turbidity measured simultaneously, and with Chla concentration and biomass of the bloom forming filamentous cyanobacteria determined from discrete water samples. PC fluorescence showed a linear relation to the biomass of the bloom forming filamentous cyanobacteria, and the other sources of PC fluorescence are considered minor in the open Baltic Sea. Estimated by PC fluorescence, cyanobacterial bloom initiated late June at the Northern Baltic Proper, rapidly extended to the central Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland, and peaked in the mid-July with values up to 10mgl−1 (fresh weight). In late July, bloom vanished in most areas. During single transects, or for the whole summer, the variability in Chla concentrations was explained more by PC fluorescence than by Chla fluorescence. Thus, filamentous cyanobacteria dominated the overall variability in phytoplankton biomass. Consequently, we show that during the cyanobacterial blooms, the estimation of Chla concentration using only Chlain vivo fluorescence is not applicable, but PC in vivo fluorescence is required as a predictor as well.},

In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm combining both three band indices and a baseline algorithm (TBBA) was developed to estimate PC concentrations and then tested in three eutrophic and turbid reservoirs. TBBA does not need to optimize wavelengths as either the traditional baseline algorithm or three-band algorithms does when it is used across different study sites. TBBA evidently corrects some effects of absorptions due to colored detritus matter and other pigments and backscattering of water column. TBBA accurately estimated PC concentrations with R2=0.8573 and rRMSE=31.4\% for water samples with the PC range from 1.4mgm−3 to 146.1mgm−3. Particularly, TBBA outperformed three-band algorithms and a previously proposed semi-empirical algorithm for the prediction of low PC (PC≤50mgm−3) concentration. Further analysis reveals that both the variations of PC:Chl-a and PC:TSM are important factors influencing the performance of all PC algorithms examined in this study and more efforts are required to improve the performance of TBBA on water samples with low PC concentration.},

Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},

Understanding these processes is important to improve the prediction of photoactive pigments in order to use them as a proxy for trophic state and harmful algal bloom. So that, both empirical and semi-analytical approaches designed for diﬀerent inland waters were tested. In addition, empirical models were tuned based on dataset collected in situ. The study was conducted in the Funil hydroelectric reservoir, where chl a ranged from 2.33 to 208.68 mg mÀ3 in May 2012 (austral fall) and 4.37 to 306.03 mg mÀ3 in October 2012 (austral spring). OLCI Sentinel-3A bands were tested in existing algorithms developed for other sensors and new band combinations were compared to analyze the errors produced. Normalized Diﬀerence Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) exhibited the best performance, with a Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 9.30\%. Result showed that wavelength at 665 nm is adequate to estimate chl a, although the maximum pigment absorption band is shifted due to phycocyanin ﬂuorescence at approximately 650 nm. Ó 2018 COSPAR.

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis and/or Microcystis were dominant in most (96\%) blooms, but community composition was not strongly correlated with toxin and taste-and-odor occurrence. Microcystins occurred in all blooms. Total microcystin concentrations measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and immunoassay were linearly related (rs = 0.76, p {\textless} 0.01) and LC/MS/MS concentrations were lower than or similar to ELISA in most (85\%) samples. Geosmin (87\%), 2-methylisoborneol (39\%), anatoxin-a (30\%), saxitoxins (17\%), cylindrospermopsins (9\%), and nodularin-R (9\%) also were present in these blooms. Multiple classes of cyanotoxins occurred in 48\% of blooms and 95\% had multiple microcystin variants. Toxins and taste-and-odor compounds frequently co-occurred (91\% of blooms), indicating odor may serve as a warning that cyanotoxins likely are present. However, toxins occurred more frequently than taste-and-odor compounds, so odor alone does not provide sufficient warning to ensure human-health protection.},

	abstract = {In freshwater lakes, harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce toxins that impact human health. However, little is known about the lake spray aerosol (LSA) produced from wave-breaking in freshwater HABs. In this study, LSA were produced in the laboratory from freshwater samples collected from Lake Michigan and Lake Erie during HAB and nonbloom conditions. The incorporation of biological material within the individual HAB-influenced LSA particles was examined by single-particle mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. Freshwater with higher blue-green algae content produced higher number fractions of individual LSA particles that contained biological material, showing that organic molecules of biological origin are incorporated in LSA from HABs. The number fraction of individual LSA particles containing biological material also increased with particle diameter (greater than 0.5 μm), a size dependence that is consistent with previous studies of sea spray aerosol impacted by phytoplankton blooms. Similar to sea spray aerosol, organic carbon markers were most frequently observed in individual LSA particles less than 0.5 μm in diameter. Understanding the transfer of biological material from freshwater to the atmosphere via LSA is crucial for determining health and climate effects of HABs.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have serious adverse effects on human and environmental health. Herein, we developed a modeling framework that predicts the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria concentrations in large reservoirs in the contiguous U.S. The framework, which uses climate change projections from five global circulation models, two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and two cyanobacterial growth scenarios, is unique in coupling climate projections with a hydrologic/water quality network model of the contiguous United States. Thus, it generates both regional and nationwide projections useful as a screening-level assessment of climate impacts on CyanoHAB prevalence as well as potential lost recreation days and associated economic value. Our projections indicate that CyanoHAB concentrations are likely to increase primarily due to water temperature increases tempered by increased nutrient levels resulting from changing demographics and climatic impacts on hydrology that drive nutrient transport. The combination of these factors results in the mean number of days of CyanoHAB occurrence ranging from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions, to 16–23 days in 2050 and 18–39 days in 2090. From a regional perspective, we find the largest increases in CyanoHAB occurrence in the Northeast U.S., while the greatest impacts to recreation, in terms of costs, are in the Southeast.},

These and other key ecosystem services are currently threatened by an excess supply of nutrients, manifested in particular by increases in the magnitude and extent of harmful planktonic and benthic algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia. Widespread concern for this important international waterbody has been manifested in a strong focus of scientific and public material on the subject, and commitments for Canada-US remedial actions in recent agreements among Federal, Provincial and State agencies. This review provides a retrospective synthesis of past and current nutrient inputs, impairments by planktonic and benthic HABs and hypoxia, modelling and Best Management Practices in the Lake Erie basin. The results demonstrate that phosphorus reduction is of primary importance, but the effects of climate, nitrogen and other factors should also be considered in the context of adaptive management.

	abstract = {Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cHABs) have significant socioeconomic and ecological costs, which impact drinking water, fisheries, agriculture, tourism, real estate, water quality, food web resilience and habitats, and contribute to anoxia and fish kills. Many of these costs are well described, but in fact are largely unmeasured. Worldwide cHABs can produce toxins (cyanotoxins), which cause acute or chronic health effects in mammals (including humans) and other organisms. There are few attempts to characterize the full health-related effects other than acute incidences, which may go unrecorded. At present these are difficult to access and evaluate and may be ascribed to other causes. Such information is fundamental to measure the full costs of cHABs and inform the need for often-costly management and remediation. This paper synthesizes information on cHABs occurrence, toxicology and health effects, and relates this to past and current conditions in the Great Lakes, a major global resource which supplies 84\% of the surface water in North America. This geographic region has seen a significant resurgence of cHABs since the 1980s. In particular we focus on Lake Erie, where increased reporting of cHABs has occurred from the early 1990's. We evaluate available information and case reports of cHAB-related illness and death and show that cHABs occur throughout the basin, with reports of animal illness and death, especially dogs and livestock. Lake Erie has consistently experienced cHABs and cyanotoxins in the last decade with probable cases of human illness, while the other Great Lakes show intermittent cHABs and toxins, but no confirmed reports on illness or toxicity. The dominant toxigenic cyanobacterium is the genus Microcystis known to produce microcystins. The presence of other cyanotoxins (anatoxin-a, paralytic shellfish toxins) implicates other toxigenic cyanobacteria such as Anabaena (Dolichospermum) and Lyngbya.},

	abstract = {[Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a worldwide problem that have been increasing in frequency and extent over the past several decades. HABs severely damage aquatic ecosystems by destroying benthic habitat, reducing invertebrate and fish populations, and affecting larger species such as dugong that rely on seagrasses for food. Few statistical models for predicting HAB occurrences have been developed, and in common with most predictive models in ecology, those that have been developed do not fully account for uncertainties in parameters and model structure. This makes management decisions based on these predictions more risky than might be supposed. We used a probit time series model and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to predict occurrences of blooms of Lyngbya majuscula, a toxic cyanophyte, in Deception Bay, Queensland, Australia. We found a suite of useful predictors for HAB occurrence, with temperature figuring prominently in models with the majority of posterior support, and a model consisting of the single covariate, average monthly minimum temperature, showed by far the greatest posterior support. A comparison of alternative model averaging strategies was made with one strategy using the full posterior distribution and a simpler approach that utilized the majority of the posterior distribution for predictions but with vastly fewer models. Both BMA approaches showed excellent predictive performance with little difference in their predictive capacity. Applications of BMA are still rare in ecology, particularly in management settings. This study demonstrates the power of BMA as an important management tool that is capable of high predictive performance while fully accounting for both parameter and model uncertainty.]},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms frequently occur globally, and forecasting could constitute an essential proactive strategy for bloom control. To decrease the cost of aquatic environmental monitoring and increase the accuracy of bloom forecasting, a novel single-parameter approach combining wavelet analysis with artificial neural networks (WNN) was developed and verified based on daily online monitoring datasets of algal density in the Siling Reservoir, China and Lake Winnebago, U.S.A. Firstly, a detailed modeling process was illustrated using the forecasting of cyanobacterial cell density in the Chinese reservoir as an example. Three WNN models occupying various prediction time intervals were optimized through model training using an early stopped training approach. All models performed well in fitting historical data and predicting the dynamics of cyanobacterial cell density, with the best model predicting cyanobacteria density one-day ahead (r = 0.986 and mean absolute error = 0.103 × 104 cells mL−1). Secondly, the potential of this novel approach was further confirmed by the precise predictions of algal biomass dynamics measured as chl a in both study sites, demonstrating its high performance in forecasting algal blooms, including cyanobacteria as well as other blooming species. Thirdly, the WNN model was compared to current algal forecasting methods (i.e. artificial neural networks, autoregressive integrated moving average model), and was found to be more accurate. In addition, the application of this novel single-parameter approach is cost effective as it requires only a buoy-mounted fluorescent probe, which is merely a fraction (∼15\%) of the cost of a typical auto-monitoring system. As such, the newly developed approach presents a promising and cost-effective tool for the future prediction and management of harmful algal blooms.},

	abstract = {Severe nuisance blooms of cyanobacteria, mainly Aphanizomenon and Microcystis, historically have plagued polymictic Ford Lake, one of the most productive warm-water sport fishing lakes in Michigan, U.S.A. Biomass development in the lake is known to be limited by phosphorus. Alternative theories ascribed nuisance conditions either to allochthonous inputs or to internal loading of phosphorus from anoxic sediments. From 2003 to 2009, there was a strong linear relationship between allochthonous total phosphorus income and phosphorus retained within the basin. The relationship had a negative intercept, implying negative retention, or positive export, of phosphorus from the lake from May to September. Mass balance calculations at lake inlet and outlet were consistent with rates of sedimentary phosphorus accumulation measured from sediment cores. Release rates of soluble reactive phosphorus from anoxic sediments were half that of allochthonous inputs. However, severe declines in nitrogen to phosphorus ratio developed in the anoxic, nitrate-poor hypolimnion because accumulation of ammonium was only tenfold that of phosphate. The result was a steep decline in ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus during July and August throughout the lake after episodic mixing events, followed by and coinciding with development of heterocystous Aphanizomenon populations. Lake sediment composition determined by X-ray fluorescence in addition to results of sediment core experiments indicates that phosphorus release is governed by an iron trap mechanism such that phosphate and iron are released only when both oxygen and nitrate are depleted.},

The objective of this study was to determine how well water quality sondes attached to buoys measure total algae and cyanobacterial biomass and water turbidity. Water samples were collected next to two data buoys in western Lake Erie (near Gibraltar Island and in the Sandusky subbasin) throughout summers 2015, 2016, and 2017 to determine correlations between buoy sonde data and water sample data. MCY and nutrient concentrations were also measured. Significant (P {\textless} 0.001) linear relationships (R2 {\textgreater} 0.75) occurred between cyanobacteria buoy and water sample data at the Gibraltar buoy, but not at the Sandusky buoy; however, the coefficients at the Gibraltar buoy differed significantly across years. There was a significant correlation between buoy and water sample total chlorophyll data at both buoys, but the coefficient varied considerably between buoys and among years. Total MCY concentrations at the Gibraltar buoy followed similar temporal patterns as buoy and water sample cyanobacterial biomass data, and the ratio of MCY to cyanobacteria-chlorophyll decreased with decreased ambient nitrate concentrations. These results suggest that buoy data are difficult to compare across time and space. Additionally, the inclusion of nitrate concentration data can lead to more robust predictions on the relative toxicity of blooms. Overall, deployed buoys with sondes that are routinely cleaned and calibrated can track relative cyanobacteria abundance and be used as an early warning system for potentially toxic blooms.},

The data compiled in this study concerns more than 500 lakes and coastal areas covering a very wide domain in terms of nutrient concentrations and salinity. There was no simple relationship between the TN/TP ratio and empirical chlorophyll concentrations or concentrations of cyanobacteria. Variations in TP rather than TN generally seem to be more important to predict variations among systems in chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria. Different “bioavailable” forms of the nutrients (DIN, DIP, phosphate, nitrate, etc.) have been shown to have very high coefficients of variation (CV), which means that many samples are needed to obtain reliable empirical data which are necessary in models aiming for high predictive power and practical usefulness.},

	abstract = {The destruction of the commonly found cyanobacterial toxin, microcystin-LR (MC-LR), in surface waters by UV-C/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP) was studied. Experiments were carried out in a bench scale photochemical apparatus with low pressure mercury vapor germicidal lamps emitting at 253.7 nm. The degradation of MC-LR was a function of UV fluence. A 93.9\% removal with an initial MC-LR concentration of 1 μM was achieved with a UV fluence of 80 mJ/cm2 and an initial H2O2 concentration of 882 μM. When increasing the concentration of MC-LR only, the UV fluence-based pseudo-first order reaction rate constant generally decreased, which was probably due to the competition between by-products and MC-LR for hydroxyl radicals. An increase in H2O2 concentration led to higher removal efficiency; however, the effect of HO scavenging by H2O2 became significant for high H2O2 concentrations. The impact of water quality parameters, such as pH, alkalinity and the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), was also studied. Field water samples from Lake Erie, Michigan and St. Johns River, Florida were employed to evaluate the potential application of this process for the degradation of MC-LR. Results showed that the presence of both alkalinity (as 89.6–117.8 mg CaCO3/L) and NOM (as ∼2 to ∼9.5 mg/L TOC) contributed to a significant decrease in the destruction rate of MC-LR. However, a final concentration of MC-LR bellow the guideline value of 1 μg/L was still achievable under current experimental conditions when an initial MC-LR concentration of 2.5 μg/L was spiked into those real water samples.},
