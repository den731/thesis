I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. David Szlag, for providing me the opportunity to grow in my laboratory skills and critical thinking. He has believed in my diverse ability to apply my knowledge in the pursuit of science. I also would like to thank Annie Ettinger for pushing me to be an effective scientist, instilling me with great laboratory management tips. I would like to thank Andrew Camilleri for those fun times running around the woods, being at awe with nature. Also I would like to thank Brian Spies and Andrew Herppich for being the best partner in all the chemical analysis on our collected samples. I also want to give special thanks to Marc Lucido, Brayden Metcalf and Mikaela Cantu for the lending their support in conducting sample preparation and analysis. I also would like to thank Dr. Raffel's and his lab group, especially Ryan Mcwhinnie and Jason Sckrabulus for doing the bulk of the field sampling and mussel counts.  I also would like to thank the Oakland University Chemistry Department, especially Dr. David Newlin and Dr. Linda Schweitzer who has personally helped me push along my graduate program and gave me hope to strive on.

I also would like to acknowledge the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for funding this research (Grant \# 36636). My research would not have happen without their financial support.
