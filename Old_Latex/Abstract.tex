The increase in harmful cyanobacteria blooms threatens freshwater ecosystems and presents a risk to human health. The rapid growth of cyanobacteria can cause rapid declines in water quality if left unchecked. A survey of 29 inland lakes was conducted to investigate microcystin. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and quantify the microcystin variants.
